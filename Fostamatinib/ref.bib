  abstract  = "Recent compelling evidence has lead to renewed interest in the
               role of antibodies and immune complexes in the pathogenesis of
               several autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
               These immune complexes, consisting of autoantibodies to
               self-antigens, can mediate inflammatory responses largely
               through binding and activating the immunoglobulin Fc receptors
               (FcRs). Using cell-based structure activity relationships with
               cultured human mast cells, we have identified the small molecule
               R406
               [N4-(2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-4H-pyrid[1,4]oxazin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2,4-pyrimidinediamine]
               as a potent inhibitor of immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and
               IgG-mediated activation of Fc receptor signaling (EC(50) for
               degranulation = 56-64 nM). Here we show that the primary target
               for R406 is the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which plays a key
               role in the signaling of activating Fc receptors and the B-cell
               receptor (BCR). R406 inhibited phosphorylation of Syk substrate
               linker for activation of T cells in mast cells and B-cell linker
               protein/SLP65 in B cells. R406 bound to the ATP binding pocket
               of Syk and inhibited its kinase activity as an ATP-competitive
               inhibitor (K(i) = 30 nM). Furthermore, R406 blocked
               Syk-dependent FcR-mediated activation of monocytes/macrophages
               and neutrophils and BCR-mediated activation of B lymphocytes.
               R406 was selective as assessed using a large panel of
               Syk-independent cell-based assays representing both specific and
               general signaling pathways. Consistent with Syk inhibition, oral
               administration of R406 to mice reduced immune complex-mediated
               inflammation in a reverse-passive Arthus reaction and two
               antibody-induced arthritis models. Finally, we report a
               first-inhuman study showing that R406 is orally bioavailable,
               achieving exposures capable of inhibiting Syk-dependent
               IgE-mediated basophil activation. Collectively, the results show
               R406 potential for modulating Syk activity in human disease.",

               is considered a promising therapeutic approach in chronic
               lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but experimental in vivo evidence to
               support this view is still lacking. We have now investigated
               whether inhibition of BCR signaling with the selective Syk
               inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) will affect the growth of
               the leukemias that develop in the E$\mu$-TCL1 transgenic mouse
               model of CLL. Similarly to human CLL, these leukemias express
               stereotyped BCRs that react with autoantigens exposed on the
               surface of senescent or apoptotic cells, suggesting that they
               are antigen driven. We show that R788 effectively inhibits BCR
               signaling in vivo, resulting in reduced proliferation and
               survival of the malignant B cells and significantly prolonged
               survival of the treated animals. The growth-inhibitory effect of
               R788 occurs despite the relatively modest cytotoxic effect in
               vitro and is independent of basal Syk activity, suggesting that
               R788 functions primarily by inhibiting antigen-dependent BCR
               signals. Importantly, the effect of R788 was found to be
               selective for the malignant clones, as no disturbance in the
               production of normal B lymphocytes was observed. Collectively,
               these data provide further rationale for clinical trials with
               R788 in CLL and establish the BCR-signaling pathway as an
               important therapeutic target in this disease.",
