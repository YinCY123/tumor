  abstract  = "Current therapies for medulloblastoma were introduced primarily
               in the 1980s and consist of predominantly cytotoxic, nontargeted
               approaches. Mortality from medulloblastoma remains significant.
               In addition, many survivors suffer from severe treatment-related
               effects of radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Further
               intensification of nonspecific therapy is unlikely to offer
               additional benefits, because survival rates have reached a
               plateau. Recent publications in medulloblastoma have revolved
               largely around the recognition that medulloblastoma per se does
               not exist, but rather, that there are a group of histologically
               similar but clinically and molecularly distinct entities that
               have been grouped under that rubric. Distinguishing the four
               molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma-wingless (WNT), sonic
               hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4-in the daily treatment of
               patients, as well in the setting of clinical trials, is an
               important challenge in the near term for the pediatric
               neuro-oncology community. The preponderance of morbidity in
               treating patients with medulloblastoma is secondary to the
               treatment or prophylaxis of leptomeningeal metastases, and the
               cause of most deaths is leptomeningeal metastases. Recurrence of
               medulloblastoma is a nearly universally fatal event, with no
               significant salvage rate. The extent of spatial and temporal
               intratumoral heterogeneity as medulloblastoma metastasizes to
               leptomeninges and as it evolves in the face of radiation and
               cytotoxic chemotherapy is just beginning to be understood as a
               major barrier to therapeutic success. Pediatric neuro-oncology
               clinicians and scientists must now determine how best to
               incorporate rapid changes in our biologic understanding of
               medulloblastoma into the next generation of upfront clinical
               trials, with the goal of both improving survival for the
               highest-risk patients and improving quality of life for
               survivors.",

               development of diverse organisms and is disrupted in a variety
               of malignancies. Pathway activation is triggered by binding of
               hedgehog proteins to the multipass Patched-1 (PTCH) receptor,
               which in the absence of hedgehog suppresses the activity of the
               seven-pass membrane protein Smoothened (SMOH). De-repression of
               SMOH culminates in the activation of one or more of the GLI
               transcription factors that regulate the transcription of
               downstream targets. Individuals with germline mutations of the
               SHH receptor gene PTCH are at high risk of developmental
               anomalies and of basal-cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas and
               other cancers (a pattern consistent with nevoid basal-cell
               carcinoma syndrome, NBCCS). In keeping with the role of PTCH as
               a tumor-suppressor gene, somatic mutations of this gene occur in
               sporadic basal-cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas. We report
               here that a subset of children with medulloblastoma carry
               germline and somatic mutations in SUFU (encoding the human
               suppressor of fused) of the SHH pathway, accompanied by loss of
               heterozygosity of the wildtype allele. Several of these
               mutations encode truncated proteins that are unable to export
               the GLI transcription factor from nucleus to cytoplasm,
               resulting in the activation of SHH signaling. SUFU is a newly
               identified tumor-suppressor gene that predisposes individuals to
               medulloblastoma by modulating the SHH signaling pathway through
               a newly identified mechanism.",

               trials a proportion of patients as high as 10-15\% is usually
               reported as having severe treatment related toxicity
               occasionally resulting in toxic death. Little is known on the
               underlying predisposition of the individual child. Several
               hereditary disorders including immunodeficiency (ID) syndromes
               or repair disorders, Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT), and Nijmegen
               breakage syndrome (NBS) were associated with an elevated risk
               for severe treatment related toxicity. PROCEDURE: This report
               involves the case of a 7-year-old boy with medulloblastoma who
               suffered from remarkably severe side effects during and after
               postoperative radio- and chemotherapy. Several months following
               craniospinal radiation with a total dose of 36 Gy, late normal
               tissue side effects were observed within the treated volume.
               Eighteen months after initiation of treatment the patient died
               due to protracted cardiopulmonary failure. RESULTS: To quantify
               the intrinsic radiation sensitivity, lymphoblastoid cells were
               used to examine chromosomal aberrations by fluorescence in situ
               hybridization detecting between two to ninefold higher
               chromosomal breakage rates in comparison to cells of average
               cancer patients. Skin fibroblasts showed in the clonogenic
               survival assays a twofold increased sensitivity. Western
               blotting demonstrated a typical lack of Nbs1. PCR-SSCP analysis
               followed by direct sequencing of positive samples revealed a
               homozygous truncating mutation of the NBS1 gene (657del5).
               CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that severe treatment related
               complications in pediatric cancer patients may be the result of
               increased intrinsic radio- and chemosensitivity due to NBS, AT,
               and other ID syndromes. It is suggested to exclude such
               conditions in all patients with anthropometric parameters below
               the 3rd centile and other signs suggestive for repair disorders

               this study was to investigate molecular subtypes and their
               prognostic implication in a large cohort of adult
               medulloblastomas as the biology in this age group remains poorly
               understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We combined transcriptome and
               DNA copy number analyses for 28 adult medulloblastomas.
               Statistical and bioinformatic tools were applied to discover
               distinct molecular variants. Clinical and molecular
               characteristics of each biologic subtype were validated using
               immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray derived from an
               independent patient cohort of adult medulloblastomas (n = 103).
               RESULTS: Gene expression profiles revealed three distinct
               molecular variants with stable subtype separation using the 300
               most varying transcripts. Distinct demographics, genetics,
               transcriptome, and prognosis were noted for each subtype of
               adult medulloblastoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed aberrant
               activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway in over half of
               adult medulloblastomas constituting a promising molecular
               therapeutic target. In contrast, subtype C tumors, which
               comprise a robust subtype in childhood medulloblastoma are only
               exceptionally seen in adult cohorts. Notably, adult subtype D
               and Wnt/wingless tumors were associated with worse prognosis
               than pediatric cohorts, whereas survival for SHH tumors was
               similar for both age groups. CONCLUSION: The transcriptome of
               adult medulloblastomas differs considerably from pediatric
               counterparts, both in terms of tumor biology and prognostic
               impact. Therefore, age-specific classification is required and
               must be adapted for use in clinical trials of adult
               medulloblastoma.",

               prognostic significance, alongside clinico-pathological
               variables, within the multi-center HIT-SIOP-PNET4 trial.
               METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were
               collected from 338 M0 patients (>4.0 years at diagnosis) for
               pathology review and assessment of the WNT subgroup (MBWNT) and
               genomic copy-number defects (chromosome 17, MYC/MYCN, 9q22
               (PTCH1) and DNA ploidy). Clinical characteristics were reviewed
               centrally. RESULTS: The favorable prognosis of MBWNT was
               confirmed, however better outcomes were observed for non-MBWNT
               tumors in this clinical risk-defined cohort compared to previous
               disease-wide clinical trials. Chromosome 17p/q defects were
               heterogeneous when assessed at the cellular copy-number level,
               and predicted poor prognosis when they occurred against a
               diploid (ch17(im)/diploid(cen)), but not polyploid, genetic
               background. These factors, together with post-surgical tumor
               residuum (R+) and radiotherapy delay, were supported as
               independent prognostic markers in multivariate testing. Notably,
               MYC and MYCN amplification were not associated with adverse
               outcome. In cross-validated survival models derived for the
               clinical standard-risk (M0/R0) disease group,
               (ch17(im)/diploid(cen); 14\% of patients) predicted high
               disease-risk, while the outcomes of patients without
               (ch17(im)/diploid(cen)) did not differ significantly from MBWNT,
               allowing re-classification of 86\% as favorable-risk.
               CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers, established previously in disease-wide
               studies, behave differently in clinically-defined standard-risk
               disease. Distinct biomarkers are required to assess disease-risk
               in this group, and define improved risk-stratification models.

               most common malignant childhood brain tumour. These tumours are
               thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25\%
               originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) after
               aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter,
               SHH subtype). The pathological processes that drive
               heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not
               known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies.
               Here we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of
               medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT
               pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT subtype) arises outside
               the cerebellum from cells of the dorsal brainstem. We found that
               genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more
               frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and
               embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL)
               and developing cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
               intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumours
               infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, whereas SHH-subtype tumours are
               located within the cerebellar hemispheres. Activating mutations
               in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in
               the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on
               the embryonic dorsal brainstem which included aberrantly
               proliferating Zic1(+) precursor cells. These lesions persisted
               in all mutant adult mice; moreover, in 15\% of cases in which
               Tp53 was concurrently deleted, they progressed to form
               medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene

  abstract  = "The Eph-ephrin signaling pathway mediates developmental
               processes and the proper functioning of the adult human body.
               This distinctive bidirectional signaling pathway includes a
               canonical downstream signal cascade inside the Eph-bearing
               cells, as well as a reverse signaling in the ephrin-bearing
               cells. The signaling is terminated by ADAM metalloproteinase
               cleavage, internalization, and degradation of the Eph/ephrin
               complexes. Consequently, the Eph-ephrin-ADAM signaling cascade
               has emerged as a key target with immense therapeutic potential
               particularly in the context of cancer. An interesting twist was
               brought forth by the emergence of ephrins as the entry receptors
               for the pathological Henipaviruses, which has spurred new
               studies to target the viral entry. The availability of
               high-resolution structures of the multi-modular Eph receptors in
               complexes with ephrins and other binding partners, such as
               peptides, small molecule inhibitors and antibodies, offers a
               wealth of information for the structure-guided development of
               therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, genomic data mining of
               Eph mutants involved in cancer provides information for targeted
               drug development. In this review we summarize the distinct
               avenues for targeting the Eph-ephrin signaling pathway,
               including its termination by ADAM proteinases. We highlight the
               latest developments in Eph-related pharmacology in the context
               of Eph-ephrin-ADAM-based antibodies and small molecules.
               Finally, the future prospects of genomics- and proteomics-based

  abstract  = "Medulloblastoma is an aggressively growing tumour, arising in
               the cerebellum or medulla/brain stem. It is the most common
               malignant brain tumour in children, and shows tremendous
               biological and clinical heterogeneity. Despite recent treatment
               advances, approximately 40\% of children experience tumour
               recurrence, and 30\% will die from their disease. Those who
               survive often have a significantly reduced quality of life. Four
               tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic
               profiles are currently identified. WNT tumours, showing
               activated wingless pathway signalling, carry a favourable
               prognosis under current treatment regimens. SHH tumours show
               hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis.
               Group 3 and 4 tumours are molecularly less well characterized,
               and also present the greatest clinical challenges. The full
               repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however,
               remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing
               analysis of 125 tumour-normal pairs, conducted as part of the
               International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor
               Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event in
               Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between
               patient age and mutation rate was observed. Several recurrent
               mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related
               genes (CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4) and in genes not previously
               linked to this tumour (DDX3X, CTDNEP1, KDM6A, TBR1), often in
               subgroup-specific patterns. RNA sequencing confirmed these
               alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our
               knowledge, the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified.
               Chromatin modifiers were frequently altered across all
               subgroups. These findings enhance our understanding of the
               genomic complexity and heterogeneity underlying medulloblastoma,
               and provide several potential targets for new therapeutics,
               especially for Group 3 and 4 patients.",

               effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies.
               Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular
               subtypes of medulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and
               copy number profiles. Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and
               deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding
               regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall,
               medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other
               paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations
               per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at
               statistically significant frequencies, including previously
               known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1,
               MLL2, SMARCA4 and TP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly
               identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with
               CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR)
               complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X
               potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell
               viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type,
               $\beta$-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration of
               WNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways
               across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this
               disease, and nominates the RNA helicase DDX3X as a component of

               peak of incidence occurs during childhood, factors operating
               very early in life might play a key role. Previous studies have
               suggested that high birth weight is associated with an increased
               brain tumor risk. The authors conducted a meta-analysis on the
               association between birth weight and risk of specific histologic
               types of primary brain tumors. They included published studies
               (1966-2007) that reported odds ratios and 95\% confidence
               intervals for brain tumors associated with birth weight. The
               authors identified eight studies involving 1,748,964 children,
               of whom 4,162 suffered from brain tumors of three histologic
               types (astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). For
               astrocytoma, high birth weight (>4,000 g) was associated with
               increased risk (odds ratio = 1.38, 95\% confidence interval
               (CI): 1.07, 1.79), with each 1,000-g increase in birth weight
               being associated with a 19\% (95\% CI: 4, 36) increase in risk.
               For medulloblastoma, high birth weight was also positively
               associated with increased risk (odds ratio = 1.27, 95\% CI:
               1.02, 1.60). No association was found for ependymoma. These

               calculated using conditional logistic regression for matched

               a clinically diagnosed viral infection during pregnancy had an
               approximately 11-fold increase in risk of developing a malignant
               neoplasm of the brain or other part of the nervous system (OR =
               10.6, 95\% CI = 1.1--503.2). In addition, non-statistically
               significant increased risks were observed among children who had
               a non-cephalic presentation (OR = 3.3, 95\% CI = 0.8--13.9) or a
               low 1-minute apgar score (OR = 2.7, 95\% CI = 1.0--7.4). No
               other aspects of the index pregnancy, delivery, or maternal
               characteristics were associated with an increased risk of
               childhood brain tumors. Conclusions: The results reported here

               factors in the etiology of childhood malignant neoplasms of the

               infectious exposure in the first year of life and the likelihood
               of developing a CNS tumor. The variables representing infectious
               exposure were social contact (including social contact with
               other infants and attendance at informal and formal day care),
               sharing a bedroom with another child, birth order, and exposure
               to a school-age child within the home. Children reported to have
               had no social contact with other infants in the first year of
               life displayed an increased risk of developing a CNS tumor when
               compared to those who had (OR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.08-1.75). This
               effect was most prominent in the primitive neuroectodermal

               findings by variable and tumor subtype suggest that an early
               exposure to infections is not strongly implicated in the
               aetiology of CNS tumors. However, the effect for social contact

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma, the largest group of embryonal
               brain tumors, has historically been classified into five
               variants based on histopathology. More recently, epigenetic and
               transcriptional analyses of primary tumors have subclassified
               medulloblastoma into four to six subgroups, most of which are
               incongruous with histopathological classification. DISCUSSION:
               Improved stratification is required for prognosis and
               development of targeted treatment strategies, to maximize cure
               and minimize adverse effects. Several mouse models of
               medulloblastoma have contributed both to an improved
               understanding of progression and to developmental therapeutics.
               In this review, we summarize the classification of human
               medulloblastoma subtypes based on histopathology and molecular
               features. We describe existing genetically engineered mouse
               models, compare these to human disease, and discuss the utility
               of mouse models for developmental therapeutics. Just as accurate
               knowledge of the correct molecular subtype of medulloblastoma is
               critical to the development of targeted therapy in patients, we
               propose that accurate modeling of each subtype of
               medulloblastoma in mice will be necessary for preclinical
               evaluation and optimization of those targeted therapies.",

               cases and is associated with a favorable disease outcome. To
               explore the molecular pathogenesis of Wnt/Wg-active
               medulloblastomas, and to investigate any genetic basis for their
               observed clinical behavior, we assessed a series of primary
               medulloblastomas for evidence of Wnt/Wg pathway activation,
               alongside a genome-wide analysis of associated copy-number
               aberrations. Cases displaying evidence of Wnt/Wg activation
               (CTNNB1 mutation and/or beta-catenin nuclear stabilisation) were
               exclusively associated with a distinct genomic signature
               involving loss of an entire copy of chromosome 6 but few other
               aberrations (p < 0.001). In contrast, Wnt/Wg-negative tumors
               coclustered into an unrelated sub-group characterised by
               multiple established genomic defects common in medulloblastoma
               (losses of chromosomes 17p, 8, 10 and 16; gains of chromosomes 7
               and 17q). Further investigation of specific genetic defects in a
               larger independent cohort demonstrated that loss of chromosome 6
               was exclusively observed in Wnt/Wg-active tumors, but not in
               Wnt/Wg-negative cases (8/13 vs. 0/19; p = 0.0001), while pathway
               activation was independent of chromosome 17 aberrations, the

               (p = 0.005). Wnt/Wg-active tumors could not be distinguished on
               the basis of clinical or pathological disease features. Our data
               indicate that Wnt/Wg-active tumors represent an independent
               molecular sub-group of medulloblastomas characterised by a
               distinct pattern of genomic aberrations. These findings provide
               a strong biological basis to support (1) the idiosyncratic
               clinical behavior of Wnt/Wg-active medulloblastomas, and (2) the
               development of beta-catenin status as an independent marker for

               Patients and Methods After surgery, patients received 36 Gy CSRT
               with boosts to sites of disease. During radiation, patients
               received 15 to 30 doses of carboplatin (30-45 mg/m2/dose), along
               with vincristine (VCR) once per week for 6 weeks. Patients on
               regimen A received 6 months of maintenance chemotherapy (MC)
               with cyclophosphamide and VCR. Once the recommended phase II
               dose (RP2D) of carboplatin was determined, cisplatin was added
               to the MC (regimen B). Results In all, 161 eligible patients
               (median age, 8.7 years; range, 3.1 to 21.6 years) were enrolled.
               Myelosuppression was dose limiting and 35 mg/m2/dose $\times$ 30
               was determined to be the RP2D of carboplatin. Twenty-nine (36\%)
               of 81 patients with M+ MB had diffuse anaplasia. Four patients
               were taken off study within 11 months of completing radiotherapy
               for presumed metastatic progression and are long-term survivors
               following palliative chemotherapy. Excluding these four
               patients, 5-year overall survival $\pm$ SE and progression-free
               survival $\pm$ SE for M+ patients treated at the RP2D on regimen
               A was 82\% $\pm$ 9\% and 71\% $\pm$ 11\% versus 68\% $\pm$ 10\%
               and 59\% $\pm$ 10\% on regimen B (P = .36). There was no
               difference in survival by M stage. Anaplasia was a negative
               predictor of outcome. Conclusion The use of carboplatin as a

               subgroups of medulloblastoma that are genetically and clinically

               one-third of all cases and comprise the majority of infant and
               adult medulloblastomas. To discern molecular heterogeneity among
               Shh-medulloblastomas, we analyzed transcriptional profiles from
               four independent Shh-medulloblastoma expression datasets (n =
               66). Unsupervised clustering analyses demonstrated a clear
               distinction between infant and adult Shh-medulloblastomas, which
               was reliably replicated across datasets. Comparison of
               transcriptomes from infant and adult Shh-medulloblastomas
               revealed deregulation of multiple gene families, including genes
               implicated in cellular development, synaptogenesis, and
               extracellular matrix maintenance. Furthermore, metastatic
               dissemination is a marker of poor prognosis in adult, but not in
               pediatric Shh-medulloblastomas. Children with desmoplastic
               Shh-medulloblastomas have a better prognosis than those with
               Shh-medulloblastomas and classic histology. Desmoplasia is not
               prognostic for adult Shh-medulloblastoma. Cytogenetic analysis
               of a large, non-overlapping cohort of Shh-medulloblastomas (n =
               151) revealed significant over-representation of chromosome 10q

               pediatric Shh cases compared with adults. Adult
               Shh-medulloblastomas harboring chromosome 10q deletion, 2 gain,
               17p deletion, 17q gain, and/or GLI2 amplification have a much
               worse prognosis as compared to pediatric cases exhibiting the

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Reports detailing the prognostic impact of TP53
               mutations in medulloblastoma offer conflicting conclusions. We
               resolve this issue through the inclusion of molecular subgroup
               profiles. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined subgroup
               affiliation, TP53 mutation status, and clinical outcome in a
               discovery cohort of 397 medulloblastomas. We subsequently
               validated our results on an independent cohort of 156
               medulloblastomas. RESULTS: TP53 mutations are enriched in
               wingless (WNT; 16\%) and sonic hedgehog (SHH; 21\%)
               medulloblastomas and are virtually absent in subgroups 3 and 4
               tumors (P < .001). Patients with SHH/TP53 mutant tumors are
               almost exclusively between ages 5 and 18 years, dramatically
               different from the general SHH distribution (P < .001). Children
               with SHH/TP53 mutant tumors harbor 56\% germline TP53 mutations,
               which are not observed in children with WNT/TP53 mutant tumors.
               Five-year overall survival (OS; $\pm$ SE) was 41\% $\pm$ 9\% and
               81\% $\pm$ 5\% for patients with SHH medulloblastomas with and
               without TP53 mutations, respectively (P < .001). Furthermore,
               TP53 mutations accounted for 72\% of deaths in children older
               than 5 years with SHH medulloblastomas. In contrast, 5-year OS
               rates were 90\% $\pm$ 9\% and 97\% $\pm$ 3\% for patients with
               WNT tumors with and without TP53 mutations (P = .21).
               Multivariate analysis revealed that TP53 status was the most
               important risk factor for SHH medulloblastoma. Survival rates in
               the validation cohort mimicked the discovery results, revealing
               that poor survival of TP53 mutations is restricted to patients
               with SHH medulloblastomas (P = .012) and not WNT tumors.
               CONCLUSION: Subgroup-specific analysis reconciles prior
               conflicting publications and confirms that TP53 mutations are
               enriched among SHH medulloblastomas, in which they portend poor
               outcome and account for a large proportion of treatment failures
               in these patients.",

               into 4 prognostically significant molecular subgroups that are
               best defined by experimental gene expression profiles: the WNT
               pathway, sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, and subgroups 3 and 4
               (non-SHH/WNT). Medulloblastoma of adults belong primarily to the
               SHH category. Vismodegib, an SHH-pathway inhibitor FDA-approved
               in 2012 for treatment of basal cell carcinoma, has been used
               successfully in the setting of chemorefractory medulloblastoma,

               vismodegib, a sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway inhibitor that binds
               smoothened (SMO), in pediatric and adult recurrent
               medulloblastoma (MB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients
               enrolled onto PBTC-025B and pediatric patients enrolled onto
               PBTC-032 were treated with vismodegib (150 to 300 mg/d).
               Protocol-defined response, which had to be sustained for 8
               weeks, was confirmed by central neuroimaging review. Molecular
               tests to identify patterns of response and insensitivity were
               performed when tissue was available. RESULTS: A total of 31
               patients were enrolled onto PBTC-025B, and 12 were enrolled onto
               PBTC-032. Three patients in PBTC-025B and one in PBTC-032, all
               with SHH-subgroup MB (SHH-MB), exhibited protocol-defined
               responses. Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in those
               with SHH-MB than in those with non-SHH-MB, and prolonged disease
               stabilization occurred in 41\% of patient cases of SHH-MB. Among
               those with SHH-MB, loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 was
               associated with prolonged PFS, and diffuse staining of P53 was
               associated with reduced PFS. Whole-exome sequencing identified
               mutations in SHH genes downstream from SMO in four of four
               tissue samples from nonresponders and upstream of SMO in two of
               four patients with favorable responses. CONCLUSION: Vismodegib
               exhibits activity against adult recurrent SHH-MB but not against
               recurrent non-SHH-MB. Inadequate accrual of pediatric patients
               precluded conclusions in this population. Molecular analyses
               support the hypothesis that SMO inhibitor activity depends on
               the genomic aberrations within the tumor. Such inhibitors should
               be advanced in SHH-MB studies; however, molecular and genomic
               work remains imperative to identify target populations that will
               truly benefit.",

               and pharmacokinetics of the smoothened inhibitor vismodegib in
               children with refractory or relapsed medulloblastoma.
               EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Initially, vismodegib was administered
               daily at 85 mg/m(2) and escalated to 170 mg/m(2). The study was
               then revised to investigate a flat-dosing schedule of 150 mg for
               patients with small body surface area (BSA, 0.67-1.32 m(2)) or
               300 mg for those who were larger (BSA, 1.33-2.20 m(2)).
               Pharmacokinetics were performed during the first course of
               therapy, and the right knees of all patients were imaged to
               monitor bone toxicity. Immunohistochemical analysis was done to
               identify patients with Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subtype
               medulloblastoma. RESULTS: Thirteen eligible patients were
               enrolled in the initial study: 6 received 85 mg/m(2) vismodegib,
               and 7 received 170 mg/m(2). Twenty eligible patients were
               enrolled in the flat-dosing part of the study: 10 at each dosage
               level. Three dose-limiting toxicities were observed, but no
               drug-related bone toxicity was documented. The median (range)
               vismodegib penetration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 0.53
               (0.26-0.78), when expressed as a ratio of the concentration of
               vismodegib in the CSF to that of the unbound drug in plasma.
               Antitumor activity was seen in 1 of 3 patients with SHH-subtype
               disease whose tumors were evaluable, and in none of the patients
               in the other subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Vismodegib was well
               tolerated in children with recurrent or refractory
               medulloblastoma; only two dose-limiting toxicities were observed
               with flat dosing. The recommended phase II study dose is 150 or
               300 mg, depending on the patient's BSA. Clin Cancer Res; 19(22);

               Embryos lacking Dullard activity fail to form primordial germ
               cells (PGCs). In the mouse, the formation of PGCs is influenced
               by BMP4 and WNT3 activity. Although Dullard is reputed to
               negatively regulate BMP receptor function, in this study we
               found mutations in Dullard had no detectable effect on BMP4 and
               p-Smad activity. Furthermore Dullard mutations did not influence
               the dosage-dependent inductive effect of Bmp4 in PGC formation.
               However, Dullard may function as a positive regulator of WNT
               signalling. Combined loss of one copy each of Dullard and Wnt3
               had a synergistic effect on the reduction of PGC numbers in the

               WNT/$\beta$-catenin signalling activity and a reduction in the
               level of Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2). Therefore, Dullard may play a
               role in the fine-tuning of WNT signalling activity by modulating

  abstract  = "AbstractMedulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant pediatric
               brain tumor and is divided into at least four subgroups known as
               WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. Here, we characterized gene
               regulation mechanisms in the most aggressive subtype, Group 3
               tumors, through genome-wide chromatin and expression profiling.
               Our results show that most active distal sites in these tumors
               are occupied by the transcription factor OTX2. Highly active
               OTX2-bound enhancers are often arranged as clusters of adjacent
               peaks and are also bound by the transcription factor NEUROD1.
               These sites are responsive to OTX2 and NEUROD1 knockdown and
               could also be generated de novo upon ectopic OTX2 expression in
               primary cells, showing that OTX2 cooperates with NEUROD1 and
               plays a major role in maintaining and possibly establishing
               regulatory elements as a pioneer factor. Among OTX2 target
               genes, we identified the kinase NEK2, whose knockdown and
               pharmacologic inhibition decreased cell viability. Our studies
               thus show that OTX2 controls the regulatory landscape of Group 3
               medulloblastoma through cooperative activity at enhancer
               elements and contributes to the expression of critical target
               genes.Significance: The gene regulation mechanisms that drive
               medulloblastoma are not well understood. Using chromatin
               profiling, we find that the transcription factor OTX2 acts as a
               pioneer factor and, in cooperation with NEUROD1, controls the
               Group 3 medulloblastoma active enhancer landscape. OTX2 itself
               or its target genes, including the mitotic kinase NEK2,
               represent attractive targets for future therapies. Cancer

               in medulloblastoma, which is the most common malignant brain
               tumor in children. It is highly expressed in most
               medulloblastomas and amplified in a subset of them. To study the
               role OTX2 has in medulloblastoma we investigated the downstream
               pathway of OTX2. We generated D425 medulloblastoma cells in
               which endogenous OTX2 can be silenced by inducible shRNA.
               Silencing of OTX2 strongly inhibited cell proliferation and
               resulted in a neuronal-like differentiation. Expression
               profiling of time courses after silencing showed a progressive
               change in gene expression for many cellular processes.
               Downregulated genes were highly enriched for cell cycle and
               visual perception genes, while upregulated genes were enriched
               for genes involved in development and differentiation. This
               shift is reminiscent of expression changes described during
               normal cerebellum development where proliferating granule
               progenitor cells have high OTX2 expression, which diminishes
               when these cells exit the cell cycle and start to differentiate.
               ChIP-on-chip analyses of OTX2 in D425 cells identified cell
               cycle and perception genes as direct OTX2 targets, while
               regulation of most differentiation genes appeared to be
               indirect. The expression of many directly regulated genes
               correlated to OTX2 expression in primary tumors, suggesting the
               in vivo relevance of these genes and their potential as targets
               for therapeutic intervention. These analyses provide more
               insight in the molecular network of OTX2, demonstrating that
               OTX2 is essential in medulloblastoma and directly drives
               proliferation by regulation of cell cycle genes.",

               (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4,
               suggesting a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed,
               trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in
               Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH medulloblastomas,
               also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.
               Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27
               methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4
               tumors. These tumors show high expression of the homeobox
               transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425
               medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb
               genes such as EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and RBBP4 and upregulation of
               H3K27 demethylases KDM6A, KDM6B, JARID2 and KDM7A. This was
               accompanied by decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K27me1 levels
               in promoter regions. Strikingly, the decrease of H3K27me3 was
               most prominent in promoters that bind OTX2. OTX2-bound promoters
               showed high levels of the H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks
               and intermediate levels of the H3K27me3 inactivation mark,
               reminiscent of a bivalent modification. After silencing of OTX2,
               H3K27me3 levels strongly dropped, but H3K4me3 and H3K9ac levels
               remained high. OTX2-bound bivalent genes showed high expression
               levels in D425, but the expression of most of these genes did
               not change after OTX2 silencing and loss of the H3K27me3 mark.
               Maintaining promoters in a bivalent state by sustaining H3K27
               trimethylation therefore seems to be an important function of
               OTX2 in medulloblastoma, while other transcription factors might
               regulate the actual expression levels of these genes.",

               their heterogeneity and to identify whether such characteristics
               represent risk factors for patients with this disease, we
               performed an integrated genomic analysis of a large series of
               primary tumors.Patients and MethodsWe profiled the mRNA
               transcriptome of 194 medulloblastomas and performed high-density
               single nucleotide polymorphism array and miRNA analysis on 115
               and 98 of these, respectively. Non-negative matrix
               factorization--based clustering of mRNA expression data was used
               to identify molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma; DNA copy
               number, miRNA profiles, and clinical outcomes were analyzed for
               each. We additionally validated our findings in three previously
               published independent medulloblastoma data
               sets.ResultsIdentified are six molecular subgroups of
               medulloblastoma, each with a unique combination of numerical and
               structural chromosomal aberrations that globally influence mRNA
               and miRNA expression. We reveal the relative contribution of
               each subgroup to clinical outcome as a whole and show that a
               previously unidentified molecular subgroup, characterized
               genetically by c-MYC copy number gains and transcriptionally by
               enrichment of photoreceptor pathways and increased
               miR-183∼96∼182 expression, is associated with significantly
               lower rates of event-free and overall survivals.ConclusionOur
               results detail the complex genomic heterogeneity of
               medulloblastomas and identify a previously unrecognized
               molecular subgroup with poor clinical outcome for which more
               effective therapeutic strategies should be developed.",

               distinct molecular disease subgroups, which offer potential for
               improved clinical management. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Minimal mRNA
               expression signatures diagnostic for the Wnt/Wingless (WNT) and
               Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroups were developed, validated, and
               used to assign subgroup affiliation in 173 tumors from four
               independent cohorts, alongside a systematic investigation of
               subgroup clinical and molecular characteristics. RESULTS: WNT
               tumors [12\% (21/173)] were diagnosed >5 years of age (peak, 10
               years), displayed classic histology, CTNNB1 mutation (19/20),
               and associated chromosome 6 loss, and have previously been
               associated with favorable prognosis. SHH cases [24\% (42/173)]
               predominated in infants (<3 years) and showed an age-dependent
               relationship to desmoplastic/nodular pathology; all infant
               desmoplastic/nodular cases (previously associated with a good
               outcome) were SHH-positive, but these relationships broke down
               in noninfants. PTCH1 mutations were common [34\% (11/32)], but
               PTCH1 exon1c hypermethylation, chromosome 9q and REN (KCTD11)
               genetic loss were not SHH associated, and SMO or SUFU mutation,
               PTCH1 exon1a or SUFU hypermethylation did not play a role,
               indicating novel activating mechanisms in the majority of SHH
               cases. SHH tumors were associated with an absence of COL1A2
               methylation. WNT/SHH-independent medulloblastomas [64\%
               (110/173)] showed all histologies, peaked at 3 and 6 years, and
               were exclusively associated with chromosome 17p loss.
               CONCLUSIONS: Medulloblastoma subgroups are characterized by
               distinct genomic, epigenomic and clinicopathologic features, and
               clinical outcomes. Validated array-independent gene expression

               precursor cells using a microarray-based approach. As determined
               by 5' RACE, full-length PRDM6 protein contains a PR domain and
               four Kr{\"u}ppel-like zinc fingers. In situ hybridization in
               mouse embryos demonstrates staining of the primitive streak,
               allantois, heart, outflow tract, paraaortic splanchnopleura
               (P-Sp)/aorto-gonadal-mesonephric (AGM) region and yolk sac, all

               also detected in embryonic and adult-derived endothelial cell
               lines. PRDM6 is co-localized with histone H4 and methylates
               H4-K20 (but not H3) in vitro and in vivo, which is consistent
               with the known participation of PR domains in histone

               embryonic endothelial cells induces apoptosis by activating
               caspase-3 and inducing G1 arrest. PRDM6 inhibits cell
               proliferation as determined by BrdU incorporation in endothelial
               cells, but not in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Overexpression
               of PRDM6 also results in reduced tube formation in cultured
               endothelial cells grown in Matrigel. Taken together, our data

               differential effects in endothelial cells and smooth muscle
               cells, and may play a role in vascular precursor differentiation

               a Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis model of medulloblastoma was used
               to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. The top hit

               the polypeptide CDK4/6 inhibitor p16(INK4)over two decades ago

               studies in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were used to

               therapeutic strategy for medulloblastoma, particularly group 3
               MYC-amplified tumors that have the worst clinical prognosis.
               Experimental Design: A protein interaction network derived from
               a Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis model of medulloblastoma was used
               to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. The top hit
               from this analysis was validated in vivo using PDX models of
               medulloblastoma implanted subcutaneously in the flank and
               orthotopically in the cerebellum of mice. Results: Informatics
               analysis identified the CDK4/6/CYCLIN D/RB pathway as a novel
               ``druggable'' pathway for multiple subgroups of medulloblastoma.
               Palbociclib, a highly specific inhibitor of CDK4/6, was found to
               inhibit RB phosphorylation and cause G1 arrest in PDX models of
               medulloblastoma. The drug caused rapid regression of Sonic
               hedgehog (SHH) and MYC-amplified group 3 medulloblastoma

               advantage to mice bearing MYC-amplified intracranial tumors.
               Conclusions: Inhibition of CDK4/6 is potentially a highly
               effective strategy for the treatment of SHH and MYC-amplified
               group 3 medulloblastoma. Clin Cancer Res; 23(19); 5802--13.

  abstract  = "Purpose Medulloblastoma comprises four distinct molecular
               subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. Current
               medulloblastoma protocols stratify patients based on clinical
               features: patient age, metastatic stage, extent of resection,
               and histologic variant. Stark prognostic and genetic differences
               among the four subgroups suggest that subgroup-specific
               molecular biomarkers could improve patient prognostication.
               Patients and Methods Molecular biomarkers were identified from a
               discovery set of 673 medulloblastomas from 43 cities around the
               world. Combined risk stratification models were designed based
               on clinical and cytogenetic biomarkers identified by
               multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses. Identified
               biomarkers were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization
               (FISH) on a nonoverlapping medulloblastoma tissue microarray (n
               = 453), with subsequent validation of the risk stratification
               models. Results Subgroup information improves the predictive
               accuracy of a multivariable survival model compared with
               clinical biomarkers alone. Most previously published cytogenetic
               biomarkers are only prognostic within a single medulloblastoma
               subgroup. Profiling six FISH biomarkers (GLI2, MYC, chromosome
               11 [chr11], chr14, 17p, and 17q) on formalin-fixed
               paraffin-embedded tissues, we can reliably and reproducibly
               identify very low-risk and very high-risk patients within SHH,
               Group 3, and Group 4 medulloblastomas. Conclusion Combining
               subgroup and cytogenetic biomarkers with established clinical
               biomarkers substantially improves patient prognostication, even
               in the context of heterogeneous clinical therapies. The
               prognostic significance of most molecular biomarkers is
               restricted to a specific subgroup. We have identified a small
               panel of cytogenetic biomarkers that reliably identifies very
               high-risk and very low-risk groups of patients, making it an
               excellent tool for selecting patients for therapy

               reports the validation of a novel diagnostic immunohistochemical
               method to distinguish SHH, WNT, and non-SHH/WNT tumors and
               details their associations with clinical, pathological and
               cytogenetic variables. A cohort (n = 235) of medulloblastomas
               from patients aged 0.4-52 years was studied for expression of
               four immunohistochemical markers: GAB1, $\beta$-catenin, filamin
               A, and YAP1. Immunoreactivity (IR) for GAB1 characterizes only
               SHH tumors and nuclear IR for $\beta$-catenin only WNT tumors.
               IRs for filamin A and YAP1 identify SHH and WNT tumors. SHH,
               WNT, and non-SHH/WNT tumors contributed 31, 14, and 55\% to the
               series. All desmoplastic/nodular (D/N) medulloblastomas were SHH
               tumors, while most WNT tumors (94\%) had a classic phenotype.
               Monosomy 6 was strongly associated with WNT tumors, while PTCH1
               loss occurred almost exclusively among SHH tumors. MYC or MYCN
               amplification and chromosome 17 imbalance occurred predominantly
               among non-SHH/WNT tumors. Among patients aged 3-16 years and
               entered onto the SIOP PNET3 trial, outcome was significantly
               better for children with WNT tumors, when compared to SHH or
               non-SHH/WNT tumors, which showed similar survival curves.
               However, high-risk factors (M+ disease, LC/A pathology, MYC
               amplification) significantly influenced survival in both SHH and
               non-SHH/WNT groups. We describe a robust method for detecting
               SHH, WNT, and non-SHH/WNT molecular subgroups in formalin-fixed

               of multiple distinct subtypes of medulloblastoma. We studied a
               large cohort of medulloblastomas to determine how many subgroups
               of the disease exist, how they differ, and the extent of overlap
               between subgroups. METHODS: We determined gene expression
               profiles and DNA copy number aberrations for 103 primary
               medulloblastomas. Bioinformatic tools were used for class
               discovery of medulloblastoma subgroups based on the most
               informative genes in the data set. Immunohistochemistry for
               subgroup-specific signature genes was used to determine subgroup
               affiliation for 294 nonoverlapping medulloblastomas on two
               independent tissue microarrays. RESULTS: Multiple unsupervised
               analyses of transcriptional profiles identified the following
               four distinct, nonoverlapping molecular variants: WNT, SHH,
               group C, and group D. Supervised analysis of these four
               subgroups revealed significant subgroup-specific demographics,
               histology, metastatic status, and DNA copy number aberrations.
               Immunohistochemistry for DKK1 (WNT), SFRP1 (SHH), NPR3 (group
               C), and KCNA1 (group D) could reliably and uniquely classify
               formalin-fixed medulloblastomas in approximately 98\% of
               patients. Group C patients (NPR3-positive tumors) exhibited a
               significantly diminished progression-free and overall survival
               irrespective of their metastatic status. CONCLUSION: Our
               integrative genomics approach to a large cohort of
               medulloblastomas has identified four disparate subgroups with
               distinct demographics, clinical presentation, transcriptional
               profiles, genetic abnormalities, and clinical outcome.
               Medulloblastomas can be reliably assigned to subgroups through
               immunohistochemistry, thereby making medulloblastoma
               subclassification widely available. Future research on

               precursor cells within the dorsal brain stem may serve as
               cellular origins for Wnt-associated medulloblastomas. To see
               whether Shh-associated medulloblastomas are also able to develop
               in the dorsal brainstem, we analyzed two lines of transgenic
               mice with constitutive Shh signaling in hGFAP- and
               Math1-positive brainstem precursor populations, respectively.
               Our results show that in both of these lines, medulloblastomas
               arise from granule neuron precursors of the cochlear nuclei, a
               derivative of the auditory lower rhombic lip. This region is

               display severe ataxia and develop cerebellar tumors that express
               synaptophysin, the mouse atonal homolog MATH1, sonic hedgehog

              Inactivation of one Ptc allele in mice results in a 14\%

               MB, correlating with desmoplastic pathology and favorable
               outcome. The majority, however, arises independently of SHH and
               displays classic or large cell anaplastic (LCA) pathology and
               poor prognosis. To identify common signaling abnormalities, we
               profiled mRNA, demonstrating misexpression of MYCN in the
               majority of human MB and negligible expression in normal
               cerebella. We clarified a role in pathogenesis by targeting MYCN
               (and luciferase) to cerebella of transgenic mice. MYCN-driven MB
               showed either classic or LCA pathologies, with Shh signaling
               activated in approximately 5\% of tumors, demonstrating that
               MYCN can drive MB independently of Shh. MB arose at high
               penetrance, consistent with a role for MYCN in initiation. Tumor
               burden correlated with bioluminescence, with rare metastatic
               spread to the leptomeninges, suggesting roles for MYCN in both
               progression and metastasis. Transient pharmacological
               down-regulation of MYCN led to both clearance and senescence of
               tumor cells, and improved survival. Targeted expression of MYCN
               thus contributes to initiation, progression, and maintenance of
               MB, suggesting a central role for MYCN in pathogenesis.",

               medulloblastoma is characterized by overexpression of the
               proto-oncogene c-Myc, which encodes a transcription factor that
               normally maintains neural progenitor cells in an
               undifferentiated, proliferating state during embryonic
               development. Myc-driven medulloblastomas typically show a
               large-cell anaplastic (LCA) histological pattern, in which tumor
               cells display large, round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. This
               subgroup of medulloblastoma is therapeutically challenging
               because it is associated with a high rate of metastatic
               dissemination, which is a powerful predictor of short patient
               survival times. Genetically engineered mouse models have
               revealed important insights into the pathogenesis of
               medulloblastoma and served as preclinical testing platforms for
               new therapies. Here we report a new mouse model of Myc-driven
               medulloblastoma, in which tumors arise in situ after retroviral
               transfer and expression of Myc in Nestin-expressing neural
               progenitor cells in the cerebella of newborn mice. Tumor
               induction required concomitant loss of Tp53 or overexpression of
               the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Like Myc-driven
               medulloblastomas in humans, the tumors induced in mice by Myc +
               Bcl-2 and Myc - Tp53 showed LCA cytoarchitecture and a high rate
               of metastatic dissemination to the spine. The fact that Myc -
               Tp53 tumors arose only in Tp53(-/-) mice, coupled with the
               inefficient germline transmission of the Tp53-null allele, made
               retroviral transfer of Myc + Bcl-2 a more practical method for
               generating LCA medulloblastomas. The high rate of spinal
               metastasis (87\% of brain tumor-bearing mice) will be an asset
               for testing new therapies that target the most lethal aspect of

               system malignancy and the most common primary tumor of the

               occurs more frequently in males and usually before 10 years of
               age. Clinical symptoms and signs are generally brief, typically
               less than 3 months in duration, and reflect the strong
               predilection of this tumor to arise within the cerebellum, most
               often in the vermis. Although much less common, the disease may
               also occur in adults, usually in the 3rd and 4th decades of
               life. Surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy
               have substantially lowered the mortality associated with this
               tumor, with 5-year survival rates now commonly well above 50\%.
               Still, both dissemination at the time of diagnosis and
               recurrence remain obstacles in achieving a cure. The tumor has
               characteristic hyperattenuation on unenhanced computed
               tomographic scans that reflects the high nuclear-cytoplasmic
               ratio seen at histologic analysis. The tumor typically appears
               heterogeneous on images, findings that are related to cyst
               formation, hemorrhage, and calcification and that are even more
               pronounced with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Evidence of
               leptomeningeal metastatic spread is present in 33\% of all cases
               at the time of diagnosis and is well evaluated with
               contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the brain and the spine.
               Although controversial, postoperative surveillance with MR
               imaging is performed at most institutions in the hope of
               facilitating a better outcome. With continued research,
               treatment of these common neoplasms should improve, perhaps even
               achieving a cure in the future.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Patients with incomplete surgical resection of
              medulloblastoma are controversially regarded as having a marker
              of high-risk disease, which leads to patients undergoing
              aggressive surgical resections, so-called second-look surgeries,
              and intensified chemoradiotherapy. All previous studies assessing
              the clinical importance of extent of resection have not accounted
              for molecular subgroup. We analysed the prognostic value of
              extent of resection in a subgroup-specific manner. METHODS: We
              retrospectively identified patients who had a histological
              diagnosis of medulloblastoma and complete data about extent of
              resection and survival from centres participating in the
              Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics International Consortium. We
              collected from resections done between April, 1997, and February,
              2013, at 35 international institutions. We established
              medulloblastoma subgroup affiliation by gene expression profiling
              on frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. We
              classified extent of resection on the basis of postoperative
              imaging as gross total resection (no residual tumour), near-total
              resection (30 Gy vs no craniospinal irradiation). The primary
              analysis outcome was the effect of extent of resection by
              molecular subgroup and the effects of other clinical variables on
              overall and progression-free survival. FINDINGS: We included 787
              patients with medulloblastoma (86 with WNT tumours, 242 with SHH
              tumours, 163 with group 3 tumours, and 296 with group 4 tumours)
              in our multivariable Cox models of progression-free and overall
              survival. We found that the prognostic benefit of increased
              extent of resection for patients with medulloblastoma is
              attenuated after molecular subgroup affiliation is taken into
              account. We identified a progression-free survival benefit for
              gross total resection over sub-total resection (hazard ratio [HR]
              1·45, 95\% CI 1·07-1·96, p=0·16) but no overall survival benefit
              (HR 1·23, 0·87-1·72, p=0·24). We saw no progression-free survival
              or overall survival benefit for gross total resection compared
              with near-total resection (HR 1·05, 0·71-1·53, p=0·8158 for
              progression-free survival and HR 1·14, 0·75-1·72, p=0·55 for
              overall survival). No significant survival benefit existed for
              greater extent of resection for patients with WNT, SHH, or group
              3 tumours (HR 1·03, 0·67-1·58, p=0·89 for sub-total resection vs
              gross total resection). For patients with group 4 tumours, gross
              total resection conferred a benefit to progression-free survival
              compared with sub-total resection (HR 1·97, 1·22-3·17, p=0·0056),
              especially for those with metastatic disease (HR 2·22, 1·00-4·93,
              p=0·050). However, gross total resection had no effect on overall
              survival compared with sub-total resection in patients with group
              4 tumours (HR 1·67, 0·93-2·99, p=0·084). INTERPRETATION: The
              prognostic benefit of increased extent of resection for patients
              with medulloblastoma is attenuated after molecular subgroup
              affiliation is taken into account. Although maximum safe surgical
              resection should remain the standard of care, surgical removal of

              underwent aggressive initial surgical resection. Review of
              surgical and neuroimaging findings documented gross total
              resection in 13 cases, near-total resection ( than 50\% resection

              sought to synthesize the body of literature on EOR and survival
              to determine if a definitive association exists. DATA
              SOURCES/ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: A PubMed search was conducted for
              the terms ``medulloblastoma'' combined with ``extent of
              resection,'' ``overall survival,'' ``progression free survival,''
              ``gross total resection,'' ``near total resection,'' ``partial
              resection,'' or ``subtotal resection.'' Studies that performed a
              statistical analysis of EOR and survival were included. RESULTS:
              Sixteen articles including 1489 patients found a statistically
              significant association between EOR and survival, 20 articles
              including 2335 patients did not find a significant association
              between EOR and survival, and 14 articles including 2950 patients
              had mixed results. The three articles that accounted for
              molecular subgroup found varying associations between EOR and
              progression free survival, while no association was found between
              EOR and overall survival. LIMITATIONS: This review is limited by
              inconsistent definitions of EOR, the retrospective nature of the
              articles analyzed, and infrequent use of multivariate statistical
              analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic importance of EOR for

               were pre-treated with 2DG for 3 hours, ABT became a potent
               inducer of apoptosis, rapidly releasing cytochrome c from the

               applications. However, whether inhibition of glycolysis will be
               effective in all types of cancer is unclear. The current study
               shows that a glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG),
               exhibits the cytotoxic effect on non-small cell lung cancer in a
               p53-dependent manner. 2DG significantly inhibits ATP production
               in p53-deficient lung cancer cells (H358) but not in p53-wt
               cells (A549). In contrast to p53-wt cells, p53-defective cells
               are unable to compensate for their need of energy via oxidative
               phosphorylation (OXPHOS) when glycolysis is inhibited. In the
               presence of p53, increased ROS from OXPHOS increases the
               expression of p53 target genes known to modulate metabolism,

               (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. Although afatinib
               (BIBW2992), a second-generation irreversible EGFR-TKI, was
               expected to overcome the acquired resistance, it showed limited
               efficacy in a recent phase III clinical study. In this study, we
               found that the inhibition of glycolysis using 2-deoxy-d-glucose
               (2DG) improves the efficacy of afatinib in H1975 and PC9-GR
               NSCLC cells with EGFR T790M. Treatment with the combination of
               2DG and afatinib induced intracellular ATP depletion in both
               H1975 and PC9-GR cells, resulting in activation of AMP-activated
               protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation played a central role in
               the cytotoxicity of the combined treatment with 2DG and afatinib
               through the inhibition of mTOR. The alteration of the AMPK/mTOR
               signaling pathway by the inhibition of glucose metabolism
               induced specific downregulation of Mcl-1, a member of the
               antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family, through translational control. The
               enhancement of afatinib sensitivity by 2DG was confirmed in the
               in vivo PC9-GR xenograft model. In conclusion, this study
               examined whether the inhibition of glucose metabolism using 2DG
               enhances sensitivity to afatinib in NSCLC cells with EGFR T790M
               through the regulation of the AMPK/mTOR/Mcl-1 signaling pathway.
               These data suggest that the combined use of an inhibitor of

  abstract  = "TRAIL (TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-related apoptosis-inducing
               ligand) a putative anti-cancer cytokine induces apoptosis
               through DISC (death-inducing signalling complex)-mediated
               activation of caspase-8 and/or cleavage of Bid. TRAIL is
               relatively specific for tumour cells but primary chronic
               lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells are
               resistant. Herein, we show that cellular metabolism influences
               cell death and that MCL cells (Z138 cell line) can
               survive/proliferate in glucose-free media by switching from
               aerobic glycolysis to 'coupled' oxidative phosphorylation.
               Extracellular flux analysis and mitochondrial inhibitors reveal
               that in the absence of glycolysis, Z138 cells have enhanced
               respiratory capacity coupled to ATP synthesis, similar to
               'classical' state 3 mitochondria. Conversely, 2-deoxyglucose
               (2DG) blocked glycolysis and partially inhibited
               glycolytic-dependent oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a
               50\% reduction in cellular ATP levels. Also, 2DG sensitised Z138
               cells to TRAIL and induced a marked decrease in caspase-8, -3,
               cFLIP(S), Bid and Mcl-1 expression but Bak remained unchanged,
               altering the Mcl-1/Bak ratio, facilitating cytochrome c release
               and cell death. Conversely, under glucose-free conditions, Z138
               cells were less sensitive to TRAIL with reduced TRAIL-R1/R2
               surface receptor expression and impaired DISC formation.
               Anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and XIAP were up-regulated while
               pro-apoptotic BAX was down-regulated. Additionally, mitochondria
               had higher levels of cytochrome c and ultrastucturally exhibited
               a condensed configuration with enhanced intracristal spaces.
               Thus, metabolic switching was accompanied by mitochondrial
               proteome and ultrastructural remodelling enabling enhanced
               respiration activity. Cytochrome c release was decreased in
               glucose-free cells, suggesting that either pore formation was
               inhibited or that cytochrome c was more tightly bound.
               Glucose-free Z138 cells were also resistant to intrinsic cell
               death stimuli (ABT-737 and ionising radiation). In summary, in
               MCL cells, the anti-glycolytic effects of 2DG and glucose
               restriction produced opposite effects on TRAIL-induced cell
               death, demonstrating that mitochondrial metabolism directly
               modulates sensitivity of tumour cells to apoptosis.",

               biological pathway and potential leads for therapeutic adjuncts.
               Previously, the small-molecule
               N-[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-oxobutanamide
               (fasentin) was identified as a chemical sensitizer to the death

               unknown. Here, we determined that fasentin alters expression of
               genes associated with nutrient and glucose deprivation.
               Consistent with this finding, culturing cells in low-glucose
               medium recapitulated the effects of fasentin and sensitized
               cells to FAS. Moreover, we showed that fasentin inhibited

               interacted with a unique site in the intracellular channel of
               this protein. Additional chemical studies with other GLUT

               partial inhibition of glucose transport as a mechanism to
               sensitize cells to death receptor stimuli. Thus, fasentin is a
               novel inhibitor of glucose transport that blocks glucose uptake

               study determined whether inhibitors of glucose and hydroperoxide
               metabolism could induce chemoradiosensitization by enhancing
               oxidative stress in lung cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A549
               and NCI-H292 human lung carcinoma cells were treated with
               2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) combined with carboplatin + ionizing
               radiation (IR). Lung cancer cells were further sensitized with
               inhibitors of glutathione (GSH)- and thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent
               metabolism [buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and auranofin,
               respectively] in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: When 2DG was
               combined with carboplatin + IR, clonogenic cell killing was
               enhanced in A549 and NCI-H292 cells, and this combination was
               more effective than paclitaxel + carboplatin + IR. The thiol
               antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) was capable of protecting
               cancer cells from 2DG + carboplatin -induced cell killing.
               Simultaneous treatment of cancer cells with BSO and auranofin,
               at doses that were not toxic as single agents, also enhanced
               lung cancer cell killing and sensitivity to 2DG + carboplatin.
               This treatment combination also increased oxidation of both GSH
               and Trx, which were inhibited by NAC. Mice treated with
               auranofin + BSO showed no alterations in circulating leukocytes

               the effects of 2DG in combined treatments with four different

               drug commonly used to treat metastatic melanoma, (ii)
               Pyrimethamine (Pyr), a pro-apoptotic antifolate drug recently
               reappraised in cancer therapy, (iii) Cisplatin (CisPt), a drug
               capable of directly binding to DNA ultimately triggering
               apoptosis of cancer cells and (iv) the kinase inhibitor
               Staurosporine (STS), a prototypical inducer of
               mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. We found that 2DG per se: (i)
               induced a cell cycle arrest in G(0) /G(1) , (ii) promoted
               autophagy, (iii) was ineffective in inducing apoptosis in
               association with the chemotherapic drug TMZ, whereas (iv) it was
               synergistic with CisPt and STS pro-apoptotic drugs through a
               mechanism involving changes of mitochondrial homeostasis.
               Conversely, (v) 2DG hindered the pro-apoptotic effects of Pyr
               via a mechanism involving either the block of cell cycle in G(0)
               /G(1) or the modification of the free radical production of the

               (RNS). Moreover, a clear-cut autophagic response involving
               endoplasmic reticulum remodelling was detectable. Since
               autophagic cytoprotection has been suggested to contribute to
               the induction of chemoresistance, these results could provide

               to different cell cultures when challenged with
               6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Herein we used rat cerebellar
               granular cell cultures to ascertain the plausible cellular
               pathways involved in pyruvate-induced cytoprotection against 0.1
               mM 6-OHDA. Pyruvate provided cytoprotection in a
               concentration-dependent manner (2-10 mM). Consistent with its
               well-established anti-oxidant capacity, pyruvate (10 mM)
               prevented 6-OHDA-induced lipid peroxidation by blocking the rise
               in intracellular peroxides and maintaining the intracellular
               reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Further experiments revealed
               that pyruvate increased Akt, but not extracellular
               signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Moreover,
               phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors attenuated
               pyruvate-induced cytoprotection indicating that PI3K-mediated
               Akt activation is necessary for pyruvate to induce
               cytoprotection. On the other hand, pyruvate also up-regulated
               glutathione peroxidase mRNA levels, but not those of the
               anti-oxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase-1 and -2, catalase or
               the anti-apoptotic oncogenes Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. In summary, our
               results strongly suggest that pyruvate, besides the anti-oxidant
               properties related to its structure, exerts cytoprotective
               actions by activating different anti-apoptotic routes that
               include gene regulation and Akt pathway activation.",

               examined the correlation between RT dose to these structures and
               development of endocrine dysfunction in this population.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dosimetric and clinical data were
               collected from children and young adults (< 26 years of age)
               with brain tumors treated with proton RT on three prospective
               studies (2003 to 2016). Deficiencies of growth hormone (GH),
               thyroid hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and gonadotropins

               dose and age. RESULTS: Of 222 patients in the study, 189 were
               evaluable by actuarial analysis, with a median follow-up of 4.4
               years (range, 0.1 to 13.3 years), with 31 patients (14\%)
               excluded from actuarial analysis for having baseline hormone
               deficiency and two patients (0.9\%) because of lack of
               follow-up. One hundred thirty patients (68.8\%) with
               medulloblastoma were treated with craniospinal irradiation (CSI)

               involved field RT, most commonly for ependymoma (13.8\%; n = 26)

              brain tumors, but it is associated with negative long-term
              sequelae. Proton beam radiation therapy (PRT), which enables

              METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 155 patients were assessed
              using age-appropriate measures for cognitive and adaptive
              functioning at start of or during PRT (baseline) and at
              follow-up. Mean age at baseline was 8.9 years; mean follow-up
              interval was 3.6 years. Diagnoses included medulloblastoma,
              craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, glial tumors, germ cell tumors,
              and others. The sample was divided by age at baseline (<6 years

              field (craniospinal irradiation [CSI; 39\%] and focal irradiation
              [61\%]). RESULTS: Scores for mean intelligence quotient (IQ) and
              adaptive functioning skills were in the average range at baseline
              and follow-up. Overall, mean IQ scores declined from 105.4 to
              102.5 (P = .005); however, only the younger CSI group showed
              significant decline. Patients receiving CSI, regardless of age,

              working memory. Adaptive skills were stable across the 4
              age-by-treatment field groups. CONCLUSIONS: At a mean of 3.6
              years after PRT, IQ declined slightly for the group, largely
              because of significant IQ decline in younger patients treated
              with CSI. No significant change was seen in patients <6 years
              treated with focal PRT or in older patients. Adaptive skills
              remained stable across age and treatment type.",

              health outcomes associated with photon radiotherapy by reducing
              toxic effects to normal tissue. We did a trial to assess late
              complications, acute side-effects, and survival associated with
              proton radiotherapy in children with medulloblastoma. METHODS: In
              this non-randomised, open-label, single-centre, phase 2 trial, we
              enrolled patients aged 3-21 years who had medulloblastoma.
              Patients had craniospinal irradiation of 18-36 Gy radiobiological
              equivalents (GyRBE) delivered at 1·8 GyRBE per fraction followed
              by a boost dose. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of
              ototoxicity at 3 years, graded with the Pediatric Oncology Group
              ototoxicity scale (0-4), in the intention-to-treat population.
              Secondary outcomes were neuroendocrine toxic effects and
              neurocognitive toxic effects, assessed by intention-to-treat.
              This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number
              NCT00105560. FINDINGS: We enrolled 59 patients from May 20, 2003,
              to Dec 10, 2009: 39 with standard-risk disease, six with
              intermediate-risk disease, and 14 with high-risk disease. 59
              patients received chemotherapy. Median follow-up of survivors was
              7·0 years (IQR 5·2-8·6). All patients received the intended doses
              of proton radiotherapy. The median craniospinal irradiation dose
              was 23·4 GyRBE (IQR 23·4-27·0) and median boost dose was 54·0
              GyRBE (IQR 54·0-54·0). Four (9\%) of 45 evaluable patients had
              grade 3-4 ototoxicity according to Pediatric Oncology Group
              ototoxicity scale in both ears at follow-up, and three (7\%) of
              45 patients developed grade 3-4 ototoxicity in one ear, although
              one later reverted to grade 2. The cumulative incidence of grade
              3-4 hearing loss at 3 years was 12\% (95\% CI 4-25). At 5 years,
              it was 16\% (95\% CI 6-29). Pediatric Oncology Group hearing
              ototoxicity score at a follow-up of 5·0 years (IQR 2·9-6·4) was
              the same as at baseline or improved by 1 point in 34 (35\%) of 98
              ears, worsened by 1 point in 21 (21\%), worsened by 2 points in
              35 (36\%), worsened by 3 points in six (6\%), and worsened by 4
              points in two (2\%). Full Scale Intelligence Quotient decreased
              by 1·5 points (95\% CI 0·9-2·1) per year after median follow-up
              up of 5·2 years (IQR 2·6-6·4), driven by decrements in processing
              speed and verbal comprehension index. Perceptual reasoning index
              and working memory did not change significantly. Cumulative
              incidence of any neuroendocrine deficit at 5 years was 55\% (95\%
              CI 41-67), with growth hormone deficit being most common. We
              recorded no cardiac, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal late toxic
              effects. 3-year progression-free survival was 83\% (95\% CI
              71-90) for all patients. In post-hoc analyses, 5-year
              progression-free survival was 80\% (95\% CI 67-88) and 5-year
              overall survival was 83\% (95\% CI 70-90). INTERPRETATION: Proton
              radiotherapy resulted in acceptable toxicity and had similar

               accomplished using an in-house 3D planning system. IMRT plans
               were developed using the KonRad treatment planning system with
               6-MV photons. RESULTS: Substantial normal-tissue dose sparing
               was realized with IMRT and proton treatment of the posterior
               fossa and spinal column. For example, the dose to 90\% of the
               cochlea was reduced from 101.2\% of the prescribed posterior
               fossa boost dose from conventional X-rays to 33.4\% and 2.4\%

               volume was reduced from 72.2\% for conventional X-rays to 29.5\%

              relapse of a decrease in the neuraxis radiation dose from 3,600
              cGy in 20 fractions to 2,340 cGy in 13 fractions in patients with
              newly diagnosed medulloblastoma between 3 and 21 years of age
              with low T stage (T1, T2 and T3A), minimal postoperative residual
              tumor, and no evidence of dissemination (M0). METHODS AND
              MATERIALS: Between June 1986 and November 1990, the Children's
              Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group randomized 126
              patients in a two-arm study comparing the two different doses of
              neuraxis irradiation. In both arms, the posterior fossa received
              5,400 cGy in 30 fractions. All patients were staged with
              myelography, postoperative lumbar cerebrospinal fluid cytology,
              and postoperative contrast-enhanced cranial computerized
              tomography to ensure no evidence of dissemination and no more
              than 1.5 cm3 residual tumor volume. Overall survival,
              progression-free survival, and patterns of recurrence were
              carefully monitored. Prospective endocrine and psychometric
              studies were performed to determine the benefit of decreasing the
              neuraxis radiation dose. RESULTS: Following an interim analysis
              at a median time on study of 16 months, the study was closed,
              since a statistically significant increase was observed in the
              number of all relapses as well as isolated neuraxis relapses in
              patients randomized to the lower dose of neuraxis radiation.
              CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma
              considered to have a good prognosis on the basis of low T stage,
              minimal residual tumor after at least subtotal resection, and no
              evidence of dissemination after thorough evaluation, there is an
              increased risk of early relapse associated with lowering the dose
              of neuraxis radiation from 3,600 cGy in 20 fractions to 2,340 cGy

               catheter ablation, recurrence of any atrial arrhythmia was a
               predictor of vascular events and total mortality (P < 0.05).
               CONCLUSION: In AF patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score $\geq$1,

               includes postoperative radiotherapy and 1 year of chemotherapy,
               does not cure many children with high-risk disease. We aimed to
               investigate the effectiveness of risk-adapted radiotherapy
               followed by a shortened period of dose-intense chemotherapy in
               children with medulloblastoma. METHODS: After resection,
               patients were classified as having average-risk medulloblastoma
               ( 1.5 cm2 residual disease or metastatic disease localised to
               neuraxis) medulloblastoma. All patients received risk-adapted
               craniospinal radiotherapy (23.4 Gy for average-risk disease and
               36.0-39.6 Gy for high-risk disease) followed by four cycles of
               cyclophosphamide-based, dose-intensive chemotherapy. Patients
               were assessed regularly for disease status and treatment
               side-effects. The primary endpoint was 5-year event-free
               survival; we also measured overall survival. This study is
               registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00003211.
               FINDINGS: Of 134 children with medulloblastoma who underwent
               treatment (86 average-risk, 48 high-risk), 119 (89\%) completed
               the planned protocol. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
               5-year overall survival was 85\% (95\% CI 75-94) in patients in
               the average-risk group and 70\% (54-84) in those in the
               high-risk group (p=0.04); 5-year event-free survival was 83\%
               (73-93) and 70\% (55-85), respectively (p=0.046). For the 116
               patients whose histology was reviewed centrally, histological
               subtype correlated with 5-year event-free survival (p=0.04):
               84\% (74-95) for classic histology, 77\% (49-100) for
               desmoplastic tumours, and 57\% (33-80) for large-cell anaplastic
               tumours. INTERPRETATION: Risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a

               improve the outcome of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.",

               of 421 patients enrolled were excluded from analysis. Sixty-six
               of the remaining 379 patients had incompletely assessable
               postoperative studies. Five-year EFS and survival for the cohort
               of 379 patients was 81\% +/- 2.1\% and 86\% +/- 9\%,
               respectively (median follow-up over 5 years). EFS was unaffected
               by sex, race, age, treatment regimen, brainstem involvement, or
               excessive anaplasia. EFS was detrimentally affected by
               neuroradiographic unassessability. Patients with areas of frank
               dissemination had a 5-year EFS of 36\% +/- 15\%. Sixty-seven
               percent of progressions had some component of dissemination.
               There were seven second malignancies. Infections occurred more
               frequently on the cyclophosphamide arm and electrolyte

              before radiation therapy as opposed to maintenance chemotherapy
              after immediate postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS AND
              MATERIALS: Between 1991 and 1997, 158 patients were enrolled and
              137 patients randomized. Seventy-two patients were allocated to
              receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy (arm I,
              investigational). Chemotherapy consisted of ifosfamide,
              etoposide, intravenous high-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, and
              cytarabine given in two cycles. In arm II (standard arm), 65
              patients were assigned to receive immediate postoperative
              radiotherapy, with concomitant vincristine followed by 8 cycles
              of maintenance chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, CCNU, and
              vincristine (``Philadelphia protocol''). All patients received
              radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis (35.2 Gy total dose, 1.6 Gy
              fractionated dose / 5 times per week followed by a boost to
              posterior fossa with 20 Gy, 2.0 Gy fractionated dose). RESULTS:
              During chemotherapy Grade III/IV infections were predominant in
              arm I (40\%). Peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity were
              prevailing in arm II (37\% and 34\%, respectively). Dose
              modification was necessary in particular in arm II (63\%). During
              radiotherapy acute toxicity was mild in the majority of patients
              and equally distributed in both arms. Myelosuppression led to a
              mean prolongation of treatment time of 11.5 days in arm I and 7.5
              days in arm II, and interruptions in 35\% of patients in arm I.
              Quality control of radiotherapy revealed correct treatment in
              more than 88\% for dose prescription, more than 88\% for coverage
              of target volume, and 98\% for field matching. At a median
              follow-up of 30 months (range 1.4-62 months), the Kaplan-Meier
              estimates for relapse-free survival at 3 years for all randomized
              patients were 0.70+/-0.08; for patients with residual disease:
              0.72+/-0.06; without residual disease: 0.68+/-0.09; M0:
              0.72+/-0.04; M1: 0.65+/-0.12; and M2/3: 0.30+/-0.15. For all
              randomized patients without M2/3 disease: 0.65+/-0.05 (arm I) and
              0.78+/-0.06 (arm II) (p < 0.03); patients between 3 and 5.9
              years: 0.60+/-0.13 and 0.64+/-0.14, respectively, but patients
              between 6 and 18 years: 0.62+/-0.09 and 0.84+/-0.08, respectively
              (p < 0.03). In a univariate analysis the only negative prognostic
              factors were M2/3 disease (p < 0.002) and an age of less than 8
              years (p < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance chemotherapy would
              seem to be more effective in low-risk medulloblastoma, especially
              in patients older than 6 years of age. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
              was accompanied by increased myelotoxicity of the subsequent
              radiotherapy, causing a higher rate of interruptions and an
              extended overall treatment time. Delayed and/or protracted
              radiotherapy may therefore have a negative impact on outcome.
              M2/3 disease was associated with a poor survival in both arms,
              suggesting the need for a more intensive treatment. Young age and
              M2/3 stage were negative prognostic factors in medulloblastoma,
              but residual or M1 disease was not, suggesting a new
              stratification system for risk subgroups. High quality of
              radiotherapy may be a major contributing factor for the overall
              outcome.",

               Treatment of 2DG in chondrocytes considerably induced ER stress
               in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was demonstrated by
               a reduction of glucose regulated protein of 94 kDa (grp94), an
               ER stress-inducible protein, as determined by a Western blot
               analysis. In addition, induction of ER stress by 2DG led to the

               66-70kDa as compared with the normally expressed 72-74 kDa

               2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which is currently under clinical
               evaluation for targeting cancer cells, not only blocks
               glycolysis thereby reducing cellular ATP, but also interferes
               with N-linked glycosylation, which leads to endoplasmic
               reticulum (ER) stress and an unfolded protein response (UPR).
               Both bioenergetic challenge and ER stress have been shown to
               activate autophagy, a bulk cellular degradation process that
               plays either a pro- or anti-death role. Here, we investigate
               which pathway 2-DG interferes with that activates autophagy and
               the role of this process in modulating 2-DG-induced toxicity.
               METHODS: Pancreatic cancer cell line 1420, melanoma cell line
               MDA-MB-435 and breast cancer cell line SKBR3 were used to
               investigate the relationship between induction by 2-DG treatment
               of ER stress/UPR, ATP reduction and activation of autophagy. ER
               stress/UPR (Grp78 and CHOP) and autophagy (LC3B II) markers were
               assayed by immunoblotting, while ATP levels were measured using
               the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Autophagy
               was also measured by immunofluorescence utilizing LC3B antibody.
               Cell death was detected with a Vi-Cell cell viability analyzer
               using trypan blue exclusion. RESULTS: In the three different
               cancer cell lines described earlier, we find that 2-DG
               upregulates autophagy, increases ER stress and lowers ATP
               levels. Addition of exogenous mannose reverses 2-DG-induced
               autophagy and ER stress but does not recover the lowered levels
               of ATP. Moreover, under anaerobic conditions where 2-DG severely
               depletes ATP, autophagy is diminished rather than activated,
               which correlates with lowered levels of the ER stress marker
               Grp78. Additionally, when autophagy is blocked by siRNA, cell
               sensitivity to 2-DG is increased corresponding with upregulation
               of ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Similar increased toxicity is
               observed with 3-methyladenine, a known autophagy inhibitor. In
               contrast, rapamycin which enhances autophagy reduces
               2-DG-induced toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results
               indicate that the major mechanism by which 2-DG stimulates
               autophagy is through ER stress/UPR and not by lowering ATP
               levels. Furthermore, autophagy plays a protective role against
               2-DG-elicited cell death apparently by relieving ER stress.
               These data suggest that combining autophagy inhibitors with 2-DG
               may be useful clinically.",

               deprivation (GD) was combined with tumor necrosis factor-related
               apoptosis inducing-ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL treatment by itself
               also only induced modest killing, but combining TRAIL with 2DG

               of caspases 3, 8 and Bid. Killing by combination treatments was

               ligands is dependent on N-linked glycosylation. The inhibitor of
               glycolysis and N-linked glycosylation, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG),
               potently inhibited surface expression of MICA/B after histone
               deacetylase inhibitor treatment; the inhibition occurred
               posttranscriptionally without affecting MICA promoter activity.
               Transient overexpression of MICA surface expression was also
               inhibited by 2DG. 2DG blocks N-linked glycosylation of MICA/B by
               a reversible mechanism that can be alleviated by addition of
               d-mannose; this does not, however, affect the inhibition of
               glycolysis. Addition of d-mannose restored MICA/B surface
               expression after 2DG treatment. In addition, specific
               pharmacological or small interfering RNA-mediated targeting of
               glycolytic enzymes did not affect MICA/B surface expression,
               strongly suggesting that N-linked glycosylation, and not
               glycolysis, is essential for MICA/B surface expression.
               Corroborating this, tunicamycin, a selective inhibitor of
               N-linked glycosylation, abolished MICA/B surface expression
               without compromising activation of MICA promoter activity. NK

               abolished by 2DG treatment and fully reconstituted by further
               addition of d-mannose. Our data suggest that posttranslational
               N-linked glycosylation is strictly required for NKG2D ligand

               aberrant glycosylation, which could likely be involved in
               modulation of NKG2D ligand expression. Our data further imply
               that chemotherapeutic use of 2DG may restrict NKG2D ligand

               Surprisingly, here we find that 2-DG is toxic in select tumor
               cell lines growing under normal oxygen tension. In contrast, a
               more potent glycolytic inhibitor, 2-fluorodeoxy-d-glucose, shows
               little or no toxicity in these cell types, indicating that a
               mechanism other than inhibition of glycolysis is responsible for
               their sensitivity to 2-DG under normoxia. A clue to this other
               mechanism comes from previous studies in which it was shown that
               2-DG interferes with viral N-linked glycosylation and is
               reversible by exogenous addition of mannose. Similarly, we find
               that 2-DG interferes with N-linked glycosylation more potently
               in the tumor cell types that are sensitive to 2-DG under
               normoxia, which can be reversed by exogenous mannose.
               Additionally, 2-DG induces an unfolded protein response,

               our results raise the possibility that in certain cases, 2-DG

               the effects of 2DG in combined treatments with four different

               drug commonly used to treat metastatic melanoma, (ii)
               Pyrimethamine (Pyr), a pro-apoptotic antifolate drug recently
               reappraised in cancer therapy, (iii) Cisplatin (CisPt), a drug
               capable of directly binding to DNA ultimately triggering
               apoptosis of cancer cells and (iv) the kinase inhibitor
               Staurosporine (STS), a prototypical inducer of
               mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. We found that 2DG per se: (i)
               induced a cell cycle arrest in G(0) /G(1) , (ii) promoted
               autophagy, (iii) was ineffective in inducing apoptosis in
               association with the chemotherapic drug TMZ, whereas (iv) it was
               synergistic with CisPt and STS pro-apoptotic drugs through a
               mechanism involving changes of mitochondrial homeostasis.
               Conversely, (v) 2DG hindered the pro-apoptotic effects of Pyr
               via a mechanism involving either the block of cell cycle in G(0)
               /G(1) or the modification of the free radical production of the

               endoplasmic reticulum remodelling was detectable. Since
               autophagic cytoprotection has been suggested to contribute to
               the induction of chemoresistance, these results could provide
               useful clues as concerns the use of 2DG as anticancer agent in

              equally effective without such side effects would be chimeric
              antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Knowing that human epidermal
              growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in many
              medulloblastomas and has been used as a CAR T target before, we
              sought to evaluate the efficacy of more sophisticated anti-HER2
              CAR T cells, as well as the feasibility and efficacy of different
              routes of delivering these cells, for the treatment of pediatric

              assays compared to control CD19 CAR T cells. In vivo, Daoy and
              D283 tumor cells were orthotopically implanted in the posterior
              fossa of NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ (NSG) mice and
              treated with regional or intravenous HER2-BBz-CAR T cells or
              control CD19 CAR T cells. Non-human primates (NHPs) bearing
              ventricular and lumbar reservoirs were treated with target
              autologous cells bearing extracellular HER2 followed by
              autologous HER2-CAR T cells intraventricularly. Cerebrospinal
              fluid and blood were collected serially to measure the
              persistence of delivered cells and cytokines. RESULTS:
              HER2-BBz-CAR T cells effectively clear medulloblastoma
              orthotopically implanted in the posterior fossa of NSG mice via
              both regional and intravenous delivery in xenograft models.
              Intravenous delivery requires a log higher dose compared to
              regional delivery. NHPs tolerated intraventricular delivery of
              autologous cells bearing extracellular HER2 followed by
              HER2-BBz-CAR T cells without experiencing any systemic toxicity.
              CONCLUSIONS: HER2-BBz-CAR T cells show excellent pre-clinical
              efficacy in vitro and in mouse medulloblastoma models, and their
              intraventricular delivery is feasible and safe in NHPs. A

               in pediatric tumors. We investigated the occurrence of ErbB
               receptor aberrations across different pediatric malignancies, to
               identify patterns of ErbB dysregulation and define biomarkers
               suitable for patient enrichment in clinical studies. PROCEDURE:
               Tissue samples from 297 patients with nervous system tumors and
               rhabdomyosarcoma were analyzed for immunohistochemical
               expression or gene amplification of epidermal growth factor
               receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
               (HER2). Exploratory analyses of HER3/HER4 expression, and mRNA
               expression of ErbB receptors/ligands (NanoString) were
               performed. Assay validation followed general procedures, with
               additional validation to address Clinical Laboratory Improvement
               Amendments (CLIA) requirements. RESULTS: In most tumor types,
               samples with high ErbB receptor expression were found with
               heterogeneous distribution. We considered increased/aberrant
               ErbB pathway activation when greater than or equal to two
               EGFR/HER2 markers were simultaneously upregulated. ErbB pathway
               dysregulation was identified in ∼20\%-30\% of samples for most
               tumor types (medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors

               intrinsic pontine gliomas, and no recurrent or refractory
               low-grade astrocytomas. In medulloblastoma/primitive
               neuroectodermal tumors and neuroblastoma, this was attributed
               mainly to high EGFR polysomy/HER2 amplification, whereas EGFR
               gene amplification was observed in some high-grade glioma
               samples. EGFR/HER2 overexpression was most prevalent in

               be evaluated for pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

              malignancies have few therapeutic options and frequently die of
              their disease. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown
              tremendous success in treating relapsed pediatric acute
              lymphoblastic leukemia, but this has not yet translated to
              treating solid tumors. This is partially due to a paucity of
              differentially expressed cell surface molecules on solid tumors
              that can be safely targeted. Here, we present B7-H3 (CD276) as a
              putative target for CAR T-cell therapy of pediatric solid tumors,
              including those arising in the central nervous system.
              EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a novel B7-H3 CAR whose binder
              is derived from a mAb that has been shown to preferentially bind
              tumor tissues and has been safely used in humans in early-phase
              clinical trials. We tested B7-H3 CAR T cells in a variety of
              pediatric cancer models. RESULTS: B7-H3 CAR T cells mediate
              significant antitumor activity in vivo, causing regression of
              established solid tumors in xenograft models including
              osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma. We demonstrate
              that B7-H3 CAR T-cell efficacy is largely dependent upon high
              surface target antigen density on tumor tissues and that activity
              is greatly diminished against target cells that express low
              levels of antigen, thus providing a possible therapeutic window
              despite low-level normal tissue expression of B7-H3. CONCLUSIONS:
              B7-H3 CAR T cells could represent an exciting therapeutic option
              for patients with certain lethal relapsed or refractory pediatric
              malignancies, and should be tested in carefully designed clinical

               approach, but is often hampered by inhibitory immune
               checkpoints. In the present study, we have studied immune
               checkpoint B7-H3 expression in a tissue cohort of human
               pediatric MB. METHODS: Expression of B7-H3 was detected by
               immunohistochemistry and classified via B7-H3 staining intensity
               and percentage of B7-H3 positive tumor cells. Subsequently,
               B7-H3 protein expression was distinguished in MB molecular
               subtypes and correlated to immune cell infiltrates, patient
               characteristics, and survival. RESULTS: B7-H3 protein expression
               was found in 23 out of 24 (96\%) human pediatric MB cases and in
               17 out of 24 (71\%) MB cases > 25\% of tumor cells had any level
               of B7-H3 expression. B7-H3 protein expression was more frequent
               on Group-4 MB as compared with other molecular subtypes (p =
               0.02). Tumors with high B7-H3 expression showed less influx of
               $\gamma$$\delta$T cells (p = 0.002) and CD3+ T cells (p =
               0.041). CONCLUSION: Immune checkpoint B7-H3 is differentially
               expressed by the large majority of pediatric MB. This further
               warrants the development of novel B7-H3-directed

              of PRAME as a target for immunotherapy. Medulloblastoma cells
              were targeted using genetically modified T cells with a
              PRAME-specific TCR (SLL TCR T cells). SLL TCR T cells efficiently
              killed medulloblastoma HLA-A*02+ DAOY cells as well as primary
              HLA-A*02+ medulloblastoma cells. Moreover, SLL TCR T cells
              controlled tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model of
              medulloblastoma. To prevent unexpected T-cell-related toxicity,
              an inducible caspase-9 (iC9) gene was introduced in frame with
              the SLL TCR; this safety switch triggered prompt elimination of
              genetically modified T cells. Altogether, these data indicate
              that T cells genetically modified with a high-affinity,
              PRAME-specific TCR and iC9 may represent a promising innovative
              approach for treating patients with HLA-A*02+
              medulloblastoma.Significance: These findings identify PRAME as a
              medulloblastoma tumor-associated antigen that can be targeted
              using genetically modified T cells. Cancer Res; 78(12); 3337-49.

  abstract  = "How the immune system attacks medulloblastoma (MB) tumors
               effectively is unclear, although natural killer (NK) cells play
               an important role in immune defense against tumor cells.
               Interactions between receptors on NK cells and ligands expressed
               by tumor cells are critical for tumor control by immunotherapy.
               In this study, we analyzed tumor samples from 54 MB patients for
               expression of major histocompatibility complex class I-related
               chains A (MICA) and UL16 binding protein (ULPB-2), which are
               ligands for the NK group 2 member D activatory receptor (NKG2D).
               The percentage of MICA and ULBP-2 positive cells was higher than
               25\% in 68\% and 6\% of MB patients, respectively. A
               moderate-high intensity of MICA cytoplasmic staining was
               observed in 46\% MB patients and weak ULBP-2 staining was
               observed in 8\% MB patients. No correlation between MICA/ULBP-2
               expression and patient outcome was found. We observed that
               HTB-186, a MB cell line, was moderately resistant to NK cell
               cytotoxicity in vitro. Blocking MICA/ULBP-2 on HTB-186, and
               NKG2D receptor on NK cells increased resistance to NK cell lysis
               in vitro. However, HLA class I blocking on HTB-186 and overnight
               incubation with IL-15 stimulated NK cells efficiently killed
               tumor cells in vitro. We conclude that although
               NKG2D/MICA-ULBP-2 interactions have a role in NK cell
               cytotoxicity against MB, high expression of HLA class I can
               protect MB from NK cell cytotoxicity. Even so, our in vitro data
               indicate that if NK cells are appropriately stimulated, they may
               have the potential to target MB in vivo.",

               NK-mediated killing involved different activating receptors

               brain tumor, that most often occurs in young children.
               Standard-of-care therapies for treating pediatric MB have
               long-term side effects, even in children who are cured. Recently
               people are exploring the potential of chimeric antigen receptor
               T (CAR-T) cell therapy in brain tumor, yet the clinical outcome
               is limited. It's reported that NKG2D ligands are wildly
               expressed in MB cells, which supports NKG2D system might play an
               important role in MB therapy. Here, we take advantage of
               NKG2D-specific CAR-T cells (KD-025) for MB treatment. Methods:
               HTB186, HTB185 and HTB187 MB cell lines as well as MB cancer
               patient samples were evaluated for NKG2D ligands expression. The
               KD-025 showed antigen-specific stimulation by cytokine secretion
               and target cell lysis. HTB186 cells, which stably express
               luciferase protein, were used to establish in vivo subcutaneous
               and xenograft models in NSG mice. Mice received a single
               treatment of 10 million KD-025 intravenously. Results: NKG2D
               ligands were detected on HTB186 and HTB187 cells and most of
               screened BM patient samples. The KD-025 was generated with CD8
               hinge region and transmembrane region, 4-1BB costimulatory
               region and CD3 zeta region. The KD-025 expression was > 50\% on
               the surface of T cells confirmed by flow cytometry.
               Co-incubation of KD-025 with HTB186 cells specifically
               upregulates TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, IL-10 and IL-2 cytokines
               and strongly lysis tumor cells even at low E:T ratio (70-80\% at
               8:1). Strikingly, KD-025 markedly eliminated xenograft tumors in
               vivo and did not exhibit significant treatment-related toxicity
               in the treated mice. Regarding to T cell persistence, the CAR-T
               cells are barely detectable 24 days after injection, which is
               comparable with CD19 CAR in our experiments as well as published
               data. No obvious pathological changes were found in the tested
               organs. Conclusions: Our work with the KD-025 contributes to the
               growing body of research committed to discovering a novel
               therapy for MB. NKG2D ligands are highly expressed on human MB
               samples. KD-025 potently respond to MB and eliminate tumor in a
               xenograft mouse model with no obvious safety issues. The results
               support future clinical trial of KD-025 in patients with MB,
               where the need for effective treatment is great.",

               their capability of killing target cells autonomously, natural

               are comparatively overexpressed in patients with poorer
               prognosis, while tumor infiltrating natural killer cells are
               more abundant in patients with better prognosis. Additionally,

               the surgical tissues of patients of four molecular subgroups,
               WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4. NCAM1 RNA level is also
               positively associated with the mutation burden in tumor (P =
               0.023). The gene-signature score is validated successfully in
               the Canadian cohort (P = 0.009) as well as its three molecular
               subgroups (SHH, Group 3 and Group 4; P = 0.047, 0.018 and 0.040

               can be stratified by gene-signature scores with distinct
               prognosis and molecular characteristics. Ligands and receptors
               of the Notch signaling pathway are overexpressed in the patient
               stratum with poorer prognosis. Tumor infiltrating natural killer
               cells are more abundant in the patient stratum with better
               prognosis.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric
               brain cancer, presents with a poor prognosis in a subset of
               patients with high risk disease, or at recurrence, where current
               therapies are ineffective. Cord blood (CB) natural killer (NK)
               cells may be promising off-the-shelf effector cells for
               immunotherapy due to their recognition of malignant cells
               without the need for a known target, ready availability from
               multiple banks, and their potential to expand exponentially.
               However, they are currently limited by immune suppressive
               cytokines secreted in the MB tumor microenvironment including
               Transforming Growth Factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$). Here, we
               address this challenge in in vitro models of MB. METHODS:
               CB-derived NK cells were modified to express a dominant negative
               TGF-$\beta$ receptor II (DNRII) using retroviral transduction.
               The ability of transduced CB cells to maintain function in the
               presence of medulloblastoma-conditioned media was then assessed.
               RESULTS: We observed that the cytotoxic ability of nontransduced
               CB-NK cells was reduced in the presence of TGF-$\beta$-rich,
               medulloblastoma-conditioned media (21.21 $\pm$ 1.19\% killing at
               E:T 5:1 in the absence vs. 14.98 $\pm$ 2.11\% in the presence of
               medulloblastoma-conditioned media, n = 8, p = 0.02), but was
               unaffected in CB-derived DNRII-transduced NK cells (21.11 $\pm$
               1.84\% killing at E:T 5:1 in the absence vs. 21.81 $\pm$ 3.37 in
               the presence of medulloblastoma-conditioned media, n = 8, p =
               0.85. We also observed decreased expression of CCR2 in
               untransduced NK cells (mean CCR2 MFI 826 $\pm$ 117 in
               untransduced NK + MB supernatant from mean CCR2 MFI 1639.29
               $\pm$ 215 in no MB supernatant, n = 7, p = 0.0156), but not in
               the transduced cells. Finally, we observed that CB-derived
               DNRII-transduced NK cells may protect surrounding immune cells
               by providing a cytokine sink for TGF-$\beta$ (decreased
               TGF-$\beta$ levels of 610 $\pm$ 265 pg/mL in CB-derived
               DNRII-transduced NK cells vs. 1817 $\pm$ 342 pg/mL in
               untransduced cells; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: CB NK cells
               expressing a TGF-$\beta$ DNRII may have a functional advantage
               over unmodified NK cells in the presence of TGF-$\beta$-rich MB,

               natural killer (NK) cells to lyse MB cell lines in vitro, but in
               vivo successes remain elusive and the efficacy and fate of NK
               cells in vivo remain unknown. METHODS: To address these
               questions, we injected MB cells into the cerebellum of
               immunodeficient mice and examined tumor growth at various days
               after tumor establishment via bioluminescence imaging. NK cells
               were labeled with a fluorine-19 (19F) MRI probe and subsequently
               injected either intratumorally or contralaterally to the tumor
               in the cerebellum and effect on tumor growth was monitored.
               RESULTS: The 19F probe efficiently labeled the NK cells and
               exhibited little cytotoxicity. Fluorine-19 MRI confirmed the
               successful and accurate delivery of the labeled NK cells to the
               cerebellum of the mice. Administration of 19F-labeled NK cells
               suppressed MB growth, with the same efficacy as unlabeled cells.
               Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of NK cells within
               the tumor, which was associated with induction of apoptosis in
               tumor cells. NK cell migration to the tumor from a distal
               location as well as activation of apoptosis was also
               demonstrated by immunohstochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
               show that NK cells present a novel opportunity for new
               strategies in MB treatment. Further, 19F-labeled NK cells can
               suppress MB growth while enabling 19F MRI to provide imaging

               natural killer (NK) cells in these tumors, with correlative

               protocol therapy up to 3 infusions weekly, in escalating doses
               from 3 $\times$ 106 to 3 $\times$ 108 NK cells/m2/infusion, for
               up to 3 cycles. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained for
               cellular profile, persistence, and phenotypic analysis of NK
               cells. Radiomic characterization on pretreatment MRI scans was
               performed in 7 patients, to develop a non-invasive imaging-based
               signature. RESULTS: Primary objectives of NK cell harvest,
               expansion, release, and safety of 112 intraventricular infusions
               of NK cells were achieved in all 9 patients. There were no
               dose-limiting toxicities. All patients showed progressive
               disease (PD), except 1 patient showed stable disease for one
               month at end of study follow-up. Another patient had transient
               radiographic response of the intraventricular tumor after 5
               infusions of NK cell before progressing to PD. At higher dose
               levels, NK cells increased in the CSF during treatment with
               repetitive infusions (mean 11.6-fold). Frequent infusions of NK
               cells resulted in CSF pleocytosis. Radiomic signatures were

               radiographic changes, although they did not attain statistical

               Current therapies consist of maximal surgical resection and

               targeted cancer treatments, new immune-based approaches for
               brain tumor therapy represent an attractive avenue. Despite
               encouraging pre-clinical data, results in patients have been
               sub-optimal, likely due to tumor-induced immune suppression and
               intrinsic resistance to immune attack. Chemotherapy and biologic
               agents may be able to disrupt these mechanisms and restore tumor
               sensitivity to immune attack. In this study, we explore whether
               a combination of gemcitabine and rapamycin can sensitize
               medulloblastoma cells to immunotherapy in vitro and in vivo.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: With the commercial medulloblastoma cell
               line, Daoy, we explored the concentrations of combinations of
               Gemcitabine with rapamycin needed to induce cytotoxicity. Next,
               we used flow cytometry to assess the cytotoxicity of
               chemotherapy-treated Daoy cells with the addition of anti-tumor
               T-cells, generated from naive T-cells stimulated in the presence
               of Daoy lysate-pulsed dendritic cells. Then, we examined the
               efficacy of chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus
               immunotherapy in tumor growth inhibition of subcutaneous
               medulloblastoma xenografts. RESULTS: Rapamycin alone at 1,000
               nM. Gemcitabine had a 3-day IC50 alone of 10 nM but in
               combination with 100 nM rapamycin, it decreased to 1 nM,
               suggesting increased cytotoxicity with combined therapy.
               Stimulated T-cells mediated in-vitro cytotoxicity, although
               background cytotoxicity of unstimulated ``na{\"\i}ve'' T-cells
               was also significant. Finally, established subcutaneous Daoy
               cell xenografts in SCID mice were treated with chemotherapy
               alone or chemotherapy plus adoptive immunotherapy (stimulated
               and non-stimulated). Gemcitabine and rapamycin alone
               significantly slowed tumor growth, but the addition of
               immunotherapy further augmented inhibition. CONCLUSION:
               Combining immunotherapy and chemo-biologic therapy inhibit
               medulloblastoma cell and xenograft growth, and may offer an
               effective treatment for patients with medulloblastoma.",

               present with distinct genetic alterations, such as mutated TP53
               or MYC amplification, pediatric medulloblastoma is a tumor
               entity with minimal mutational load and low immunogenicity.
               METHODS: We identified tumor-specific mutations using
               next-generation sequencing of medulloblastoma DNA and RNA
               derived from primary tumor samples from pediatric patients.
               Tumor-specific mutations were confirmed using deep sequencing
               and in silico analyses predicted high binding affinity of the
               neoantigen-derived peptides to the patients' human leukocyte
               antigen molecules. Tumor-specific peptides were synthesized and
               used to induce a de novo T-cell response characterized by
               interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha release of CD8+
               cytotoxic T cells in vitro. RESULTS: Despite low mutational
               tumor burden, at least two immunogenic tumor-specific peptides
               were identified in each patient. T cells showed a balanced
               CD4/CD8 ratio and mostly effector memory phenotype. Induction of
               a CD8-specific T-cell response was achieved for the neoepitopes

               autologous, personalized T cell immunotherapy. Our data indicate
               that aberrant splice junctions are the primary source of
               neoantigens in medulloblastoma, a common pediatric brain tumor.
               Proteogenomically identified tumor-specific peptides are
               immunogenic and generate MHC II-based T cell responses.
               Moreover, polyclonal and polyfunctional T cells specific for
               tumor-specific peptides effectively eliminate tumor cells in
               vitro. Targeting tumor-specific antigens obviates the issue of
               central immune tolerance while potentially providing a safety
               margin favoring combination with other immune-activating
               therapies. These findings demonstrate the proteogenomic
               discovery of immunogenic tumor-specific peptides and lay the
               groundwork for personalized targeted T cell therapies for
               children with brain tumors.",

               cells in some MBs were recently shown to express CD1d and be
               susceptible to V$\alpha$24-invariant natural killer T (NKT)-cell
               cytotoxicity, the clinical relevance of CD1d expression in MB
               patients remains unknown. We investigated the expression of CD1d
               in pediatric MBs and correlated with molecular and clinical
               characteristics. Specifically, we explored if NKT cell therapy
               can be targeted at a subset of pediatric MBs with poorer
               prognosis. Particularly, infantile MBs have a worse outcome
               because radiotherapy is delayed to avoid neurocognitive
               sequelae. Immunohistochemistry for CD1d was performed on a
               screening set of 38 primary pediatric MBs. Gene expression of
               the membrane form of M2 macrophage marker, CD163, was studied in
               an expanded cohort of 60 tumors. Outcome data was collected
               prospectively. Thirteen of 38 MBs (34.2 \%) expressed CD1d on
               immunohistochemistry. CD1d was expressed mainly on MB tumor
               cells, and on some tumor-associated macrophages. Majority
               (18/22, 82 \%) of non sonic-hedgehog/Wingless-activated MBs
               (group 3 and 4) were CD1d-negative (p = 0.05). A subset of
               infantile MBs (4/9, 44.4 \%) expressed CD1d. Macrophages
               infiltrating MB expressed CD163 apart from CD1d. Molecular
               subtypes demonstrated statistical differences in CD163
               expression, SHH-tumors were the most enriched (p = 0.006).
               Molecular and clinical subtypes of pediatric MB exhibit distinct
               differences in CD1d expression, which have important therapeutic
               implications. High CD1d expression in infantile MBs offers
