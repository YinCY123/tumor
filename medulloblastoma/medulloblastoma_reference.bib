  abstract  = "Current therapies for medulloblastoma were introduced primarily
               in the 1980s and consist of predominantly cytotoxic, nontargeted
               approaches. Mortality from medulloblastoma remains significant.
               In addition, many survivors suffer from severe treatment-related
               effects of radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Further
               intensification of nonspecific therapy is unlikely to offer
               additional benefits, because survival rates have reached a
               plateau. Recent publications in medulloblastoma have revolved
               largely around the recognition that medulloblastoma per se does
               not exist, but rather, that there are a group of histologically
               similar but clinically and molecularly distinct entities that
               have been grouped under that rubric. Distinguishing the four
               molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma-wingless (WNT), sonic
               hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4-in the daily treatment of
               patients, as well in the setting of clinical trials, is an
               important challenge in the near term for the pediatric
               neuro-oncology community. The preponderance of morbidity in
               treating patients with medulloblastoma is secondary to the
               treatment or prophylaxis of leptomeningeal metastases, and the
               cause of most deaths is leptomeningeal metastases. Recurrence of
               medulloblastoma is a nearly universally fatal event, with no
               significant salvage rate. The extent of spatial and temporal
               intratumoral heterogeneity as medulloblastoma metastasizes to
               leptomeninges and as it evolves in the face of radiation and
               cytotoxic chemotherapy is just beginning to be understood as a
               major barrier to therapeutic success. Pediatric neuro-oncology
               clinicians and scientists must now determine how best to
               incorporate rapid changes in our biologic understanding of
               medulloblastoma into the next generation of upfront clinical
               trials, with the goal of both improving survival for the
               highest-risk patients and improving quality of life for
               survivors.",

               development of diverse organisms and is disrupted in a variety
               of malignancies. Pathway activation is triggered by binding of
               hedgehog proteins to the multipass Patched-1 (PTCH) receptor,
               which in the absence of hedgehog suppresses the activity of the
               seven-pass membrane protein Smoothened (SMOH). De-repression of
               SMOH culminates in the activation of one or more of the GLI
               transcription factors that regulate the transcription of
               downstream targets. Individuals with germline mutations of the
               SHH receptor gene PTCH are at high risk of developmental
               anomalies and of basal-cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas and
               other cancers (a pattern consistent with nevoid basal-cell
               carcinoma syndrome, NBCCS). In keeping with the role of PTCH as
               a tumor-suppressor gene, somatic mutations of this gene occur in
               sporadic basal-cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas. We report
               here that a subset of children with medulloblastoma carry
               germline and somatic mutations in SUFU (encoding the human
               suppressor of fused) of the SHH pathway, accompanied by loss of
               heterozygosity of the wildtype allele. Several of these
               mutations encode truncated proteins that are unable to export
               the GLI transcription factor from nucleus to cytoplasm,
               resulting in the activation of SHH signaling. SUFU is a newly
               identified tumor-suppressor gene that predisposes individuals to
               medulloblastoma by modulating the SHH signaling pathway through
               a newly identified mechanism.",

               trials a proportion of patients as high as 10-15\% is usually
               reported as having severe treatment related toxicity
               occasionally resulting in toxic death. Little is known on the
               underlying predisposition of the individual child. Several
               hereditary disorders including immunodeficiency (ID) syndromes
               or repair disorders, Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT), and Nijmegen
               breakage syndrome (NBS) were associated with an elevated risk
               for severe treatment related toxicity. PROCEDURE: This report
               involves the case of a 7-year-old boy with medulloblastoma who
               suffered from remarkably severe side effects during and after
               postoperative radio- and chemotherapy. Several months following
               craniospinal radiation with a total dose of 36 Gy, late normal
               tissue side effects were observed within the treated volume.
               Eighteen months after initiation of treatment the patient died
               due to protracted cardiopulmonary failure. RESULTS: To quantify
               the intrinsic radiation sensitivity, lymphoblastoid cells were
               used to examine chromosomal aberrations by fluorescence in situ
               hybridization detecting between two to ninefold higher
               chromosomal breakage rates in comparison to cells of average
               cancer patients. Skin fibroblasts showed in the clonogenic
               survival assays a twofold increased sensitivity. Western
               blotting demonstrated a typical lack of Nbs1. PCR-SSCP analysis
               followed by direct sequencing of positive samples revealed a
               homozygous truncating mutation of the NBS1 gene (657del5).
               CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that severe treatment related
               complications in pediatric cancer patients may be the result of
               increased intrinsic radio- and chemosensitivity due to NBS, AT,
               and other ID syndromes. It is suggested to exclude such
               conditions in all patients with anthropometric parameters below
               the 3rd centile and other signs suggestive for repair disorders

               this study was to investigate molecular subtypes and their
               prognostic implication in a large cohort of adult
               medulloblastomas as the biology in this age group remains poorly
               understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We combined transcriptome and
               DNA copy number analyses for 28 adult medulloblastomas.
               Statistical and bioinformatic tools were applied to discover
               distinct molecular variants. Clinical and molecular
               characteristics of each biologic subtype were validated using
               immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray derived from an
               independent patient cohort of adult medulloblastomas (n = 103).
               RESULTS: Gene expression profiles revealed three distinct
               molecular variants with stable subtype separation using the 300
               most varying transcripts. Distinct demographics, genetics,
               transcriptome, and prognosis were noted for each subtype of
               adult medulloblastoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed aberrant
               activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway in over half of
               adult medulloblastomas constituting a promising molecular
               therapeutic target. In contrast, subtype C tumors, which
               comprise a robust subtype in childhood medulloblastoma are only
               exceptionally seen in adult cohorts. Notably, adult subtype D
               and Wnt/wingless tumors were associated with worse prognosis
               than pediatric cohorts, whereas survival for SHH tumors was
               similar for both age groups. CONCLUSION: The transcriptome of
               adult medulloblastomas differs considerably from pediatric
               counterparts, both in terms of tumor biology and prognostic
               impact. Therefore, age-specific classification is required and
               must be adapted for use in clinical trials of adult
               medulloblastoma.",

               prognostic significance, alongside clinico-pathological
               variables, within the multi-center HIT-SIOP-PNET4 trial.
               METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were
               collected from 338 M0 patients (>4.0 years at diagnosis) for
               pathology review and assessment of the WNT subgroup (MBWNT) and
               genomic copy-number defects (chromosome 17, MYC/MYCN, 9q22
               (PTCH1) and DNA ploidy). Clinical characteristics were reviewed
               centrally. RESULTS: The favorable prognosis of MBWNT was
               confirmed, however better outcomes were observed for non-MBWNT
               tumors in this clinical risk-defined cohort compared to previous
               disease-wide clinical trials. Chromosome 17p/q defects were
               heterogeneous when assessed at the cellular copy-number level,
               and predicted poor prognosis when they occurred against a
               diploid (ch17(im)/diploid(cen)), but not polyploid, genetic
               background. These factors, together with post-surgical tumor
               residuum (R+) and radiotherapy delay, were supported as
               independent prognostic markers in multivariate testing. Notably,
               MYC and MYCN amplification were not associated with adverse
               outcome. In cross-validated survival models derived for the
               clinical standard-risk (M0/R0) disease group,
               (ch17(im)/diploid(cen); 14\% of patients) predicted high
               disease-risk, while the outcomes of patients without
               (ch17(im)/diploid(cen)) did not differ significantly from MBWNT,
               allowing re-classification of 86\% as favorable-risk.
               CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers, established previously in disease-wide
               studies, behave differently in clinically-defined standard-risk
               disease. Distinct biomarkers are required to assess disease-risk
               in this group, and define improved risk-stratification models.

               most common malignant childhood brain tumour. These tumours are
               thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25\%
               originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) after
               aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter,
               SHH subtype). The pathological processes that drive
               heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not
               known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies.
               Here we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of
               medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT
               pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT subtype) arises outside
               the cerebellum from cells of the dorsal brainstem. We found that
               genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more
               frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and
               embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL)
               and developing cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
               intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumours
               infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, whereas SHH-subtype tumours are
               located within the cerebellar hemispheres. Activating mutations
               in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in
               the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on
               the embryonic dorsal brainstem which included aberrantly
               proliferating Zic1(+) precursor cells. These lesions persisted
               in all mutant adult mice; moreover, in 15\% of cases in which
               Tp53 was concurrently deleted, they progressed to form
               medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene

  abstract  = "The Eph-ephrin signaling pathway mediates developmental
               processes and the proper functioning of the adult human body.
               This distinctive bidirectional signaling pathway includes a
               canonical downstream signal cascade inside the Eph-bearing
               cells, as well as a reverse signaling in the ephrin-bearing
               cells. The signaling is terminated by ADAM metalloproteinase
               cleavage, internalization, and degradation of the Eph/ephrin
               complexes. Consequently, the Eph-ephrin-ADAM signaling cascade
               has emerged as a key target with immense therapeutic potential
               particularly in the context of cancer. An interesting twist was
               brought forth by the emergence of ephrins as the entry receptors
               for the pathological Henipaviruses, which has spurred new
               studies to target the viral entry. The availability of
               high-resolution structures of the multi-modular Eph receptors in
               complexes with ephrins and other binding partners, such as
               peptides, small molecule inhibitors and antibodies, offers a
               wealth of information for the structure-guided development of
               therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, genomic data mining of
               Eph mutants involved in cancer provides information for targeted
               drug development. In this review we summarize the distinct
               avenues for targeting the Eph-ephrin signaling pathway,
               including its termination by ADAM proteinases. We highlight the
               latest developments in Eph-related pharmacology in the context
               of Eph-ephrin-ADAM-based antibodies and small molecules.
               Finally, the future prospects of genomics- and proteomics-based

  abstract  = "Medulloblastoma is an aggressively growing tumour, arising in
               the cerebellum or medulla/brain stem. It is the most common
               malignant brain tumour in children, and shows tremendous
               biological and clinical heterogeneity. Despite recent treatment
               advances, approximately 40\% of children experience tumour
               recurrence, and 30\% will die from their disease. Those who
               survive often have a significantly reduced quality of life. Four
               tumour subgroups with distinct clinical, biological and genetic
               profiles are currently identified. WNT tumours, showing
               activated wingless pathway signalling, carry a favourable
               prognosis under current treatment regimens. SHH tumours show
               hedgehog pathway activation, and have an intermediate prognosis.
               Group 3 and 4 tumours are molecularly less well characterized,
               and also present the greatest clinical challenges. The full
               repertoire of genetic events driving this distinction, however,
               remains unclear. Here we describe an integrative deep-sequencing
               analysis of 125 tumour-normal pairs, conducted as part of the
               International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PedBrain Tumor
               Project. Tetraploidy was identified as a frequent early event in
               Group 3 and 4 tumours, and a positive correlation between
               patient age and mutation rate was observed. Several recurrent
               mutations were identified, both in known medulloblastoma-related
               genes (CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4) and in genes not previously
               linked to this tumour (DDX3X, CTDNEP1, KDM6A, TBR1), often in
               subgroup-specific patterns. RNA sequencing confirmed these
               alterations, and revealed the expression of what are, to our
               knowledge, the first medulloblastoma fusion genes identified.
               Chromatin modifiers were frequently altered across all
               subgroups. These findings enhance our understanding of the
               genomic complexity and heterogeneity underlying medulloblastoma,
               and provide several potential targets for new therapeutics,
               especially for Group 3 and 4 patients.",

               effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies.
               Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular
               subtypes of medulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and
               copy number profiles. Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and
               deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding
               regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall,
               medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other
               paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations
               per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at
               statistically significant frequencies, including previously
               known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1,
               MLL2, SMARCA4 and TP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly
               identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with
               CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR)
               complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X
               potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell
               viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type,
               $\beta$-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration of
               WNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways
               across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this
               disease, and nominates the RNA helicase DDX3X as a component of

               peak of incidence occurs during childhood, factors operating
               very early in life might play a key role. Previous studies have
               suggested that high birth weight is associated with an increased
               brain tumor risk. The authors conducted a meta-analysis on the
               association between birth weight and risk of specific histologic
               types of primary brain tumors. They included published studies
               (1966-2007) that reported odds ratios and 95\% confidence
               intervals for brain tumors associated with birth weight. The
               authors identified eight studies involving 1,748,964 children,
               of whom 4,162 suffered from brain tumors of three histologic
               types (astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). For
               astrocytoma, high birth weight (>4,000 g) was associated with
               increased risk (odds ratio = 1.38, 95\% confidence interval
               (CI): 1.07, 1.79), with each 1,000-g increase in birth weight
               being associated with a 19\% (95\% CI: 4, 36) increase in risk.
               For medulloblastoma, high birth weight was also positively
               associated with increased risk (odds ratio = 1.27, 95\% CI:
               1.02, 1.60). No association was found for ependymoma. These

               calculated using conditional logistic regression for matched

               a clinically diagnosed viral infection during pregnancy had an
               approximately 11-fold increase in risk of developing a malignant
               neoplasm of the brain or other part of the nervous system (OR =
               10.6, 95\% CI = 1.1--503.2). In addition, non-statistically
               significant increased risks were observed among children who had
               a non-cephalic presentation (OR = 3.3, 95\% CI = 0.8--13.9) or a
               low 1-minute apgar score (OR = 2.7, 95\% CI = 1.0--7.4). No
               other aspects of the index pregnancy, delivery, or maternal
               characteristics were associated with an increased risk of
               childhood brain tumors. Conclusions: The results reported here

               factors in the etiology of childhood malignant neoplasms of the

               infectious exposure in the first year of life and the likelihood
               of developing a CNS tumor. The variables representing infectious
               exposure were social contact (including social contact with
               other infants and attendance at informal and formal day care),
               sharing a bedroom with another child, birth order, and exposure
               to a school-age child within the home. Children reported to have
               had no social contact with other infants in the first year of
               life displayed an increased risk of developing a CNS tumor when
               compared to those who had (OR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.08-1.75). This
               effect was most prominent in the primitive neuroectodermal

               findings by variable and tumor subtype suggest that an early
               exposure to infections is not strongly implicated in the
               aetiology of CNS tumors. However, the effect for social contact

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma, the largest group of embryonal
               brain tumors, has historically been classified into five
               variants based on histopathology. More recently, epigenetic and
               transcriptional analyses of primary tumors have subclassified
               medulloblastoma into four to six subgroups, most of which are
               incongruous with histopathological classification. DISCUSSION:
               Improved stratification is required for prognosis and
               development of targeted treatment strategies, to maximize cure
               and minimize adverse effects. Several mouse models of
               medulloblastoma have contributed both to an improved
               understanding of progression and to developmental therapeutics.
               In this review, we summarize the classification of human
               medulloblastoma subtypes based on histopathology and molecular
               features. We describe existing genetically engineered mouse
               models, compare these to human disease, and discuss the utility
               of mouse models for developmental therapeutics. Just as accurate
               knowledge of the correct molecular subtype of medulloblastoma is
               critical to the development of targeted therapy in patients, we
               propose that accurate modeling of each subtype of
               medulloblastoma in mice will be necessary for preclinical
               evaluation and optimization of those targeted therapies.",

               cases and is associated with a favorable disease outcome. To
               explore the molecular pathogenesis of Wnt/Wg-active
               medulloblastomas, and to investigate any genetic basis for their
               observed clinical behavior, we assessed a series of primary
               medulloblastomas for evidence of Wnt/Wg pathway activation,
               alongside a genome-wide analysis of associated copy-number
               aberrations. Cases displaying evidence of Wnt/Wg activation
               (CTNNB1 mutation and/or beta-catenin nuclear stabilisation) were
               exclusively associated with a distinct genomic signature
               involving loss of an entire copy of chromosome 6 but few other
               aberrations (p < 0.001). In contrast, Wnt/Wg-negative tumors
               coclustered into an unrelated sub-group characterised by
               multiple established genomic defects common in medulloblastoma
               (losses of chromosomes 17p, 8, 10 and 16; gains of chromosomes 7
               and 17q). Further investigation of specific genetic defects in a
               larger independent cohort demonstrated that loss of chromosome 6
               was exclusively observed in Wnt/Wg-active tumors, but not in
               Wnt/Wg-negative cases (8/13 vs. 0/19; p = 0.0001), while pathway
               activation was independent of chromosome 17 aberrations, the

               (p = 0.005). Wnt/Wg-active tumors could not be distinguished on
               the basis of clinical or pathological disease features. Our data
               indicate that Wnt/Wg-active tumors represent an independent
               molecular sub-group of medulloblastomas characterised by a
               distinct pattern of genomic aberrations. These findings provide
               a strong biological basis to support (1) the idiosyncratic
               clinical behavior of Wnt/Wg-active medulloblastomas, and (2) the
               development of beta-catenin status as an independent marker for

               Patients and Methods After surgery, patients received 36 Gy CSRT
               with boosts to sites of disease. During radiation, patients
               received 15 to 30 doses of carboplatin (30-45 mg/m2/dose), along
               with vincristine (VCR) once per week for 6 weeks. Patients on
               regimen A received 6 months of maintenance chemotherapy (MC)
               with cyclophosphamide and VCR. Once the recommended phase II
               dose (RP2D) of carboplatin was determined, cisplatin was added
               to the MC (regimen B). Results In all, 161 eligible patients
               (median age, 8.7 years; range, 3.1 to 21.6 years) were enrolled.
               Myelosuppression was dose limiting and 35 mg/m2/dose $\times$ 30
               was determined to be the RP2D of carboplatin. Twenty-nine (36\%)
               of 81 patients with M+ MB had diffuse anaplasia. Four patients
               were taken off study within 11 months of completing radiotherapy
               for presumed metastatic progression and are long-term survivors
               following palliative chemotherapy. Excluding these four
               patients, 5-year overall survival $\pm$ SE and progression-free
               survival $\pm$ SE for M+ patients treated at the RP2D on regimen
               A was 82\% $\pm$ 9\% and 71\% $\pm$ 11\% versus 68\% $\pm$ 10\%
               and 59\% $\pm$ 10\% on regimen B (P = .36). There was no
               difference in survival by M stage. Anaplasia was a negative
               predictor of outcome. Conclusion The use of carboplatin as a

               subgroups of medulloblastoma that are genetically and clinically

               one-third of all cases and comprise the majority of infant and
               adult medulloblastomas. To discern molecular heterogeneity among
               Shh-medulloblastomas, we analyzed transcriptional profiles from
               four independent Shh-medulloblastoma expression datasets (n =
               66). Unsupervised clustering analyses demonstrated a clear
               distinction between infant and adult Shh-medulloblastomas, which
               was reliably replicated across datasets. Comparison of
               transcriptomes from infant and adult Shh-medulloblastomas
               revealed deregulation of multiple gene families, including genes
               implicated in cellular development, synaptogenesis, and
               extracellular matrix maintenance. Furthermore, metastatic
               dissemination is a marker of poor prognosis in adult, but not in
               pediatric Shh-medulloblastomas. Children with desmoplastic
               Shh-medulloblastomas have a better prognosis than those with
               Shh-medulloblastomas and classic histology. Desmoplasia is not
               prognostic for adult Shh-medulloblastoma. Cytogenetic analysis
               of a large, non-overlapping cohort of Shh-medulloblastomas (n =
               151) revealed significant over-representation of chromosome 10q

               pediatric Shh cases compared with adults. Adult
               Shh-medulloblastomas harboring chromosome 10q deletion, 2 gain,
               17p deletion, 17q gain, and/or GLI2 amplification have a much
               worse prognosis as compared to pediatric cases exhibiting the

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Reports detailing the prognostic impact of TP53
               mutations in medulloblastoma offer conflicting conclusions. We
               resolve this issue through the inclusion of molecular subgroup
               profiles. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined subgroup
               affiliation, TP53 mutation status, and clinical outcome in a
               discovery cohort of 397 medulloblastomas. We subsequently
               validated our results on an independent cohort of 156
               medulloblastomas. RESULTS: TP53 mutations are enriched in
               wingless (WNT; 16\%) and sonic hedgehog (SHH; 21\%)
               medulloblastomas and are virtually absent in subgroups 3 and 4
               tumors (P < .001). Patients with SHH/TP53 mutant tumors are
               almost exclusively between ages 5 and 18 years, dramatically
               different from the general SHH distribution (P < .001). Children
               with SHH/TP53 mutant tumors harbor 56\% germline TP53 mutations,
               which are not observed in children with WNT/TP53 mutant tumors.
               Five-year overall survival (OS; $\pm$ SE) was 41\% $\pm$ 9\% and
               81\% $\pm$ 5\% for patients with SHH medulloblastomas with and
               without TP53 mutations, respectively (P < .001). Furthermore,
               TP53 mutations accounted for 72\% of deaths in children older
               than 5 years with SHH medulloblastomas. In contrast, 5-year OS
               rates were 90\% $\pm$ 9\% and 97\% $\pm$ 3\% for patients with
               WNT tumors with and without TP53 mutations (P = .21).
               Multivariate analysis revealed that TP53 status was the most
               important risk factor for SHH medulloblastoma. Survival rates in
               the validation cohort mimicked the discovery results, revealing
               that poor survival of TP53 mutations is restricted to patients
               with SHH medulloblastomas (P = .012) and not WNT tumors.
               CONCLUSION: Subgroup-specific analysis reconciles prior
               conflicting publications and confirms that TP53 mutations are
               enriched among SHH medulloblastomas, in which they portend poor
               outcome and account for a large proportion of treatment failures
               in these patients.",

               into 4 prognostically significant molecular subgroups that are
               best defined by experimental gene expression profiles: the WNT
               pathway, sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, and subgroups 3 and 4
               (non-SHH/WNT). Medulloblastoma of adults belong primarily to the
               SHH category. Vismodegib, an SHH-pathway inhibitor FDA-approved
               in 2012 for treatment of basal cell carcinoma, has been used
               successfully in the setting of chemorefractory medulloblastoma,

               vismodegib, a sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway inhibitor that binds
               smoothened (SMO), in pediatric and adult recurrent
               medulloblastoma (MB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients
               enrolled onto PBTC-025B and pediatric patients enrolled onto
               PBTC-032 were treated with vismodegib (150 to 300 mg/d).
               Protocol-defined response, which had to be sustained for 8
               weeks, was confirmed by central neuroimaging review. Molecular
               tests to identify patterns of response and insensitivity were
               performed when tissue was available. RESULTS: A total of 31
               patients were enrolled onto PBTC-025B, and 12 were enrolled onto
               PBTC-032. Three patients in PBTC-025B and one in PBTC-032, all
               with SHH-subgroup MB (SHH-MB), exhibited protocol-defined
               responses. Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in those
               with SHH-MB than in those with non-SHH-MB, and prolonged disease
               stabilization occurred in 41\% of patient cases of SHH-MB. Among
               those with SHH-MB, loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 was
               associated with prolonged PFS, and diffuse staining of P53 was
               associated with reduced PFS. Whole-exome sequencing identified
               mutations in SHH genes downstream from SMO in four of four
               tissue samples from nonresponders and upstream of SMO in two of
               four patients with favorable responses. CONCLUSION: Vismodegib
               exhibits activity against adult recurrent SHH-MB but not against
               recurrent non-SHH-MB. Inadequate accrual of pediatric patients
               precluded conclusions in this population. Molecular analyses
               support the hypothesis that SMO inhibitor activity depends on
               the genomic aberrations within the tumor. Such inhibitors should
               be advanced in SHH-MB studies; however, molecular and genomic
               work remains imperative to identify target populations that will
               truly benefit.",

               and pharmacokinetics of the smoothened inhibitor vismodegib in
               children with refractory or relapsed medulloblastoma.
               EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Initially, vismodegib was administered
               daily at 85 mg/m(2) and escalated to 170 mg/m(2). The study was
               then revised to investigate a flat-dosing schedule of 150 mg for
               patients with small body surface area (BSA, 0.67-1.32 m(2)) or
               300 mg for those who were larger (BSA, 1.33-2.20 m(2)).
               Pharmacokinetics were performed during the first course of
               therapy, and the right knees of all patients were imaged to
               monitor bone toxicity. Immunohistochemical analysis was done to
               identify patients with Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subtype
               medulloblastoma. RESULTS: Thirteen eligible patients were
               enrolled in the initial study: 6 received 85 mg/m(2) vismodegib,
               and 7 received 170 mg/m(2). Twenty eligible patients were
               enrolled in the flat-dosing part of the study: 10 at each dosage
               level. Three dose-limiting toxicities were observed, but no
               drug-related bone toxicity was documented. The median (range)
               vismodegib penetration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 0.53
               (0.26-0.78), when expressed as a ratio of the concentration of
               vismodegib in the CSF to that of the unbound drug in plasma.
               Antitumor activity was seen in 1 of 3 patients with SHH-subtype
               disease whose tumors were evaluable, and in none of the patients
               in the other subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Vismodegib was well
               tolerated in children with recurrent or refractory
               medulloblastoma; only two dose-limiting toxicities were observed
               with flat dosing. The recommended phase II study dose is 150 or
               300 mg, depending on the patient's BSA. Clin Cancer Res; 19(22);

               Embryos lacking Dullard activity fail to form primordial germ
               cells (PGCs). In the mouse, the formation of PGCs is influenced
               by BMP4 and WNT3 activity. Although Dullard is reputed to
               negatively regulate BMP receptor function, in this study we
               found mutations in Dullard had no detectable effect on BMP4 and
               p-Smad activity. Furthermore Dullard mutations did not influence
               the dosage-dependent inductive effect of Bmp4 in PGC formation.
               However, Dullard may function as a positive regulator of WNT
               signalling. Combined loss of one copy each of Dullard and Wnt3
               had a synergistic effect on the reduction of PGC numbers in the

               WNT/$\beta$-catenin signalling activity and a reduction in the
               level of Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2). Therefore, Dullard may play a
               role in the fine-tuning of WNT signalling activity by modulating

  abstract  = "AbstractMedulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant pediatric
               brain tumor and is divided into at least four subgroups known as
               WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. Here, we characterized gene
               regulation mechanisms in the most aggressive subtype, Group 3
               tumors, through genome-wide chromatin and expression profiling.
               Our results show that most active distal sites in these tumors
               are occupied by the transcription factor OTX2. Highly active
               OTX2-bound enhancers are often arranged as clusters of adjacent
               peaks and are also bound by the transcription factor NEUROD1.
               These sites are responsive to OTX2 and NEUROD1 knockdown and
               could also be generated de novo upon ectopic OTX2 expression in
               primary cells, showing that OTX2 cooperates with NEUROD1 and
               plays a major role in maintaining and possibly establishing
               regulatory elements as a pioneer factor. Among OTX2 target
               genes, we identified the kinase NEK2, whose knockdown and
               pharmacologic inhibition decreased cell viability. Our studies
               thus show that OTX2 controls the regulatory landscape of Group 3
               medulloblastoma through cooperative activity at enhancer
               elements and contributes to the expression of critical target
               genes.Significance: The gene regulation mechanisms that drive
               medulloblastoma are not well understood. Using chromatin
               profiling, we find that the transcription factor OTX2 acts as a
               pioneer factor and, in cooperation with NEUROD1, controls the
               Group 3 medulloblastoma active enhancer landscape. OTX2 itself
               or its target genes, including the mitotic kinase NEK2,

               in medulloblastoma, which is the most common malignant brain
               tumor in children. It is highly expressed in most
               medulloblastomas and amplified in a subset of them. To study the
               role OTX2 has in medulloblastoma we investigated the downstream
               pathway of OTX2. We generated D425 medulloblastoma cells in
               which endogenous OTX2 can be silenced by inducible shRNA.
               Silencing of OTX2 strongly inhibited cell proliferation and
               resulted in a neuronal-like differentiation. Expression
               profiling of time courses after silencing showed a progressive
               change in gene expression for many cellular processes.
               Downregulated genes were highly enriched for cell cycle and
               visual perception genes, while upregulated genes were enriched
               for genes involved in development and differentiation. This
               shift is reminiscent of expression changes described during
               normal cerebellum development where proliferating granule
               progenitor cells have high OTX2 expression, which diminishes
               when these cells exit the cell cycle and start to differentiate.
               ChIP-on-chip analyses of OTX2 in D425 cells identified cell
               cycle and perception genes as direct OTX2 targets, while
               regulation of most differentiation genes appeared to be
               indirect. The expression of many directly regulated genes
               correlated to OTX2 expression in primary tumors, suggesting the
               in vivo relevance of these genes and their potential as targets
               for therapeutic intervention. These analyses provide more
               insight in the molecular network of OTX2, demonstrating that
               OTX2 is essential in medulloblastoma and directly drives
               proliferation by regulation of cell cycle genes.",

               (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4,
               suggesting a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed,
               trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in
               Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH medulloblastomas,
               also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.
               Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27
               methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4
               tumors. These tumors show high expression of the homeobox
               transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425
               medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb
               genes such as EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and RBBP4 and upregulation of
               H3K27 demethylases KDM6A, KDM6B, JARID2 and KDM7A. This was
               accompanied by decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K27me1 levels
               in promoter regions. Strikingly, the decrease of H3K27me3 was
               most prominent in promoters that bind OTX2. OTX2-bound promoters
               showed high levels of the H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks
               and intermediate levels of the H3K27me3 inactivation mark,
               reminiscent of a bivalent modification. After silencing of OTX2,
               H3K27me3 levels strongly dropped, but H3K4me3 and H3K9ac levels
               remained high. OTX2-bound bivalent genes showed high expression
               levels in D425, but the expression of most of these genes did
               not change after OTX2 silencing and loss of the H3K27me3 mark.
               Maintaining promoters in a bivalent state by sustaining H3K27
               trimethylation therefore seems to be an important function of
               OTX2 in medulloblastoma, while other transcription factors might
               regulate the actual expression levels of these genes.",
