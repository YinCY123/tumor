# data
## summary
Markers predicting response and resistance to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma are currently missing. We subjected cells isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow before and after the application of CAR T cells directed against B cell maturation antigen to single cell multi-omic analyses to identify markers associated with resistance and early relapse.

## design
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) and Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells (BMMC) collected at day of leukapheresis and approximately 30 days after CAR T cell infusion were subjected to Single Cell RNA, T Cell Receptor, B Cell Receptor and Surface Proteome Sequencing
